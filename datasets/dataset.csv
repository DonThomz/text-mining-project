"Keep related supplies in the same area. Make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session. Place loose supplies in large, clearly visible containers. Use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches, photos, and reference material. Use every inch of the room for storage, especially vertical space. Use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls. Purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi-permanent. Make a habit of throwing out old, excess, or useless stuff each month.",How to Be an Organized Artist1,"If you're a photographer, keep all the necessary lens, cords, and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio. Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:Essential supplies area -- the things you use every day.Inspiration and reference area.Dedicated work area .Infrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way. , This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.Even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.  As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:Canvas shoe racks on the back of the doorWine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.Plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc.  Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration.  Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials.  Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.  A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art.  Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.Don't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.","[""If you're a photographer, keep all the necessary lens, cords, and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio."", 'Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc.', 'Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area.', 'Some ideas include:Essential supplies area -- the things you use every day.', 'Inspiration and reference area.', 'Dedicated work area .Infrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.', "", This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night."", 'Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces.', 'Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.', 'Even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.', 'As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight.', 'By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly.', 'Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:Canvas shoe racks on the back of the doorWine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.', 'Plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc.', ""Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape."", 'Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration.', ""Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space."", ""Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies."", 'The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials.', 'Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space.', 'You can even use it for smaller areas.', 'Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.', 'A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently.', 'This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything.', 'Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art.', 'Once a month, do a purge of your studio.', ""If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later."", 'Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess.', 'This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter.', 'It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.', ""Don't be sentimental here."", ""If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months."", 'Toss it.']"
"Create a sketch in the NeoPopRealist manner of the future mural on a small piece of paper 8""x10"" using the black ink pen. Prepare to create your NeoPopRealist mural. Prepare your paint. Begin your project with a design. Produce a scaled down version of your finished mural. Prepare the wall to be painted. After you have primed the surface, measure the wall. Paint in the base coat of the background. Allow the background and base coats to dry. Draw the lines, then fill the appeared section with different repetitive patterns (examine the images above). Paint patterns with brushes of suitable size for the particular portion of work you are painting. Clean up the lines and shapes as needed. Seal the mural if needed. Be inspired and it will help you succeed!",How to Create a Neopoprealist Art Work,"See the image for how this drawing develops step-by-step. However, there is an important detail: the following drawings are to examine it, and then, to create something unique.Use the lines to create the image shape and sections.Fill appeared sections with different patterns/ ornaments.Add text if needed, for example ""NeoPopRealism is 25!""Add a colored strip on the top, any color you wish. , Painting a mural always requires some preparation. You‘ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed. Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.This surface should be smooth and flat. However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.  For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice. For interior walls, use latex paints. Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs. By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.Large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.Paints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications. In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention. For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.  See sample above. The design will give you a sense of proportion. You will have unique requirements and elements.  Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject. Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color.  If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder. For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold.  Mark the horizontal and vertical lines.  Use white paint as background.  Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground. Everything depends on the complexity of your mural. If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand.  Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white). However, mistakes can be touched up later. Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing.  An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns.  If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location. Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred.  If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning, overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer.  However, if you won't be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brain's grays matter, you'll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse, with doodling or so-called zen-doodling. But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities, which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ' Neopoprealist instructional books. Other, the copycats' self-promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission.","['See the image for how this drawing develops step-by-step.', 'However, there is an important detail: the following drawings are to examine it, and then, to create something unique.', 'Use the lines to create the image shape and sections.', 'Fill appeared sections with different patterns/ ornaments.', 'Add text if needed, for example ""NeoPopRealism is 25!""Add a colored strip on the top, any color you wish.', ', Painting a mural always requires some preparation.', 'You‘ll need equipment and effort, but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed.', 'Painting a mural requires a suitable location, with the right surface that can be painted.', 'This surface should be smooth and flat.', 'However, even rough-textured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project.', 'For exterior projects that last for years, using a newer 100% acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice.', 'For interior walls, use latex paints.', 'Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs.', 'By measuring the total wall area to be covered, the total amount of paint can be calculated, but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one.', 'Large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer, where details may be added with brushes.', 'Paints are sensitive to high temperatures, humidity, direct sunlight, however, the interior projects do not have many complications.', 'In public places, keeping the mural protected may require attention.', 'For that reason, if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25-year anniversary in school or office, you can consider using varnish for your mural.', 'See sample above.', 'The design will give you a sense of proportion.', 'You will have unique requirements and elements.', 'Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject.', 'Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color.', 'If the surface is low, the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder.', 'For higher work, you may have to rent a scaffold.', 'Mark the horizontal and vertical lines.', 'Use white paint as background.', 'Then begin marking, using your scaled sketch, the location of key elements of objects, located in the foreground.', 'Everything depends on the complexity of your mural.', 'If you are confident in your artistic results, you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand.', 'Be careful, keep clean transition edges from one color (black) to another (white).', 'However, mistakes can be touched up later.', 'Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing.', 'An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes, limbs, use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns.', 'If you have a drip or run, paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location.', 'Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred.', 'If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning, overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer.', ""However, if you won't be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brain's grays matter, you'll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse, with doodling or so-called zen-doodling."", ""But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities, which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ' Neopoprealist instructional books."", ""Other, the copycats' self-promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission.""]"
"Get a bachelor’s degree. Enroll in a studio-based program. Train on a number of VFX computer programs. Watch online tutorials. Nurture your artistic side. Pay close attention to movies, television shows, and video games. Develop a specialization.",How to Be a Visual Effects Artist1,"It is possible to become a VFX artist without a college degree, but the path is often easier with one. VFX artists usually major in fine arts, computer graphics, or animation. Choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates. The availability of internships is another factor to consider.Out of the jobs advertised for VFX artists, a majority at any given time specify a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for applicants. , Some studios offer short-term programs for people who want to learn more about VFX artistry without pursuing a college degree. Enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isn’t always offered, but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from.  Although you may create some hand sketches, the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up-to-date programs. Stay informed about the newest software advances by following VFX blogs and taking online computer tutorials.For example, VFX artists are expected to be well-versed in graphics and animation programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite and JavaScript.Clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume.  Hop onto YouTube or another video service and search for VFX clip reels or demonstrations. Some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set, such as shading, which you then can practice on your own. Challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks, or even try to improve upon the models used.  Take as many art and design classes as you can. Or, simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills. As you draw, consider factors such as lighting and framing. Even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a person’s face.Make a choice to become an observer of the world around you. Ask yourself: how could I capture the movement of the leaves? Or, in what situations do shadows appear?, Watch all of these creations with an eye for detail. Look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see. Try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting. Research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like.  As you gain more experience, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design. This will become your “calling card” and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work. To build your specialization, start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars.For example, some VFX specialists focus on human character’s faces, animal figures, or city backgrounds.","['It is possible to become a VFX artist without a college degree, but the path is often easier with one.', 'VFX artists usually major in fine arts, computer graphics, or animation.', 'Choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates.', 'The availability of internships is another factor to consider.', 'Out of the jobs advertised for VFX artists, a majority at any given time specify a bachelor’s degree as a minimum requirement for applicants.', ', Some studios offer short-term programs for people who want to learn more about VFX artistry without pursuing a college degree.', 'Enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isn’t always offered, but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from.', 'Although you may create some hand sketches, the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up-to-date programs.', 'Stay informed about the newest software advances by following VFX blogs and taking online computer tutorials.', 'For example, VFX artists are expected to be well-versed in graphics and animation programs, such as Adobe Creative Suite and JavaScript.', 'Clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume.', 'Hop onto YouTube or another video service and search for VFX clip reels or demonstrations.', 'Some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set, such as shading, which you then can practice on your own.', 'Challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks, or even try to improve upon the models used.', 'Take as many art and design classes as you can.', 'Or, simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills.', 'As you draw, consider factors such as lighting and framing.', 'Even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a person’s face.', 'Make a choice to become an observer of the world around you.', 'Ask yourself: how could I capture the movement of the leaves?', 'Or, in what situations do shadows appear?, Watch all of these creations with an eye for detail.', 'Look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see.', 'Try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting.', 'Research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like.', 'As you gain more experience, you’ll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design.', 'This will become your “calling card” and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work.', 'To build your specialization, start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars.', 'For example, some VFX specialists focus on human character’s faces, animal figures, or city backgrounds.']"
"Start with some experience or interest in art. Understand the difference between art collectors, art investors and art speculators. Figure out what you are willing to pay for art, before going to an auction house. Pay attention to what schools of art are selling well, and which are down. Focus art investments on fine art paintings, rather than decorative art. Reach out to trusted auction houses and dealers when you are looking to buy art. Buy your investment art when you feel confident of its worth, its price and its ability to grow in value. Study how art is properly stored. Have your art investments appraised occasionally. Consider renting out your art investments. Understand that selling an art investment can take time.",How to Become an Art Investor,"The best art investors do their research on the pieces of art that they buy, so someone with some education or interest in the art world is more likely to understand this niche market. As well as personal research, you will need to have contacts with people in the art world, such as auctioneers, gallery directors and dealers, who can give you good investment advice. , You may confuse these three terms, if you are not careful. Each of them has a slightly different goal in mind when looking to buy art.Art collectors do not buy art for investment purposes. They buy it to decorate and display in their home. Because they consider them to be an important part of their home or life, most art collectors have a hard time parting with pieces of their collection. While many collectors do end up selling some pieces of art, it may be done because of necessity. Collectors often loan their works out to museums and occasionally donate them to museums upon their death.Art investors seek to diversify their portfolio with an art investment. Some investment firms put about two and a half to three percent of their investment money in art. They seek good advice and often buy paintings that are older and have been popular historically, such as paintings by the Old Masters. These investments are kept over decades, and sold off when the market is right, with the investor seeking to get a six to ten percent profit rise per year. These investments are also often made to be given as inheritance to future generations of the family. Art investment is often undertaken by the very wealthy.Art speculators try to invest in art that they believe will appreciate in value. They aim to buy art at a low price from budding artists in the beginning of their careers. Then they hope to sell their work in 10 to 15 years when the artists are at the peak of their careers and people or collectors are willing to pay much more for their pieces.

Get all the information you can out of them before making a purchase. If you are going to buy at auction, be prepared to walk away if the price goes higher than your investment range.Beware of art auctioneers or dealers that promise too high a return on paintings. In many ways, they are just like stock brokers and other financial investment firms, who may promise anything to get a sale. They should be found trustworthy before you buy anything, because ponzi schemes and art market bubbles are part of this investment landscape as well.If you have never bought art in an auction environment before, you may want to seek advice about how it is done properly.

"Keep your reference materials, sketches, articles, photos, etc, in one easy to find place. Make ""studies,"" or practice sketches, to organize effectively for larger projects. Limit the supplies you leave out to the project at hand. Keep an updated list of all of the necessary supplies, and the quantities of each. Break down bigger works into more easily completed parts.",How to Be an Organized Artist2,"As you start planning for a project or work, you'll likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches. While everyone has a strategy, there is nothing more maddening than digging through a book or the internet to re-find the cool idea you saw three months ago. Try out:Dedicating 1 notebook, preferably with insert folders, to each project.Making a bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration.Tacking up physical inspiration on a wall or cork board near your workspace.  Very few artists simply dive right into large projects. Almost 100% of the time they instead work on related, smaller projects called ""studies"" to prepare for the larger work. You might practice the face of the portrait you're making, sketch our different composition ideas, or practice a vulnerable or difficult part of a sculpture. Keep these organized as a way to prepare both the skills, ideas, and supplies needed for the final project.  At the end of the day, artists are visual people, and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process. Of course, neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies. Find a compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use, and leaving a little bit of ""essential"" clutter. It's okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio -- just make sure it's the inspiration you need for the current project.Just because you ""aren't organized"" is no excuse not to make an attempt. Don't feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess-- there is a middle ground.  Nothing is worse than spending a long night on a painting only to realize you've run out of white paint halfway through a section. Once a week, or more frequently if possible, check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes a problem.A simple spreadsheet or notebook, marked at the end of each artistic session, is a quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff.  Deciding to paint a mural is a huge undertaking. But sketching the idea, transposing the image onto the wall, painting the basic colors, then adding shading/detail are four separate and more manageable projects.

"Keep all of your past work organized and accessible. Record all of your artistic contacts and connections in one place. Log the costs of supplies needed for each project.

There is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects.  More than many industries, successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists, curators, instructors, and gallery assistants to be successful. You never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand, or when you'll have some work you want to place in a friend's art show.

Make notes of:Phone numberEmailLocationRole in the art worldHow you met or connected.  If you're looking to make a living off art, you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business. This, however, does not need to interfere with your creative process. Simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy.You can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes, as they are private business expenses. Keeping expenses organized isn't just about time, it is about saving money.  If you're making the same or similar pieces each day, you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made. So, if 10 wood sculptures cost you $100, each sculpture cost you $10 to make (100/10 = 10). This may seem trivial, but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work.At the very least, ensure that you are not losing money on each piece.  If you want an organized, productive artistic practice, you need to know about the trends around your work. Keeping organized is about more than just your own studio, it is about understanding the art market you're a part of. Peruse Etsy, visit galleries and show openings, and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices.  While it doesn't have a dollar value, make sure you value your time as well as your materials. In the earlier example, don't forget that it cost more than just $10 to make the sculpture. Your hours of work and experience are essential too, so don't sell the piece for $20 if it took you a week to make. While pricing your work is difficult, don't balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for -- not everyone can do what you do, and people are paying for your talent and experience.At the very least, consider what you'd be paid if you used your time otherwise. Twenty hours spent painting could be worth $15 an hour at another job. You should consider this ""missed"" money when pricing work.If you want to make art your living, you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself. Careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off.","[""When you finish a project, whether it sells or not, don't just stuff it away in a drawer."", ""You never know when you'll want to revisit and idea or, more excitingly, when interest in your current work will drive up interest in past projects."", 'If you do electronic work, back it up every 3-6 months on a dedicated hard drive.', 'There is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects.', 'More than many industries, successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists, curators, instructors, and gallery assistants to be successful.', ""You never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand, or when you'll have some work you want to place in a friend's art show."", ""Don't leave meetings and connections up to chance -- organize and compile your contact information in once place for later."", 'Make notes of:Phone numberEmailLocationRole in the art worldHow you met or connected.', ""If you're looking to make a living off art, you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business."", 'This, however, does not need to interfere with your creative process.', 'Simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy.', 'You can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes, as they are private business expenses.', ""Keeping expenses organized isn't just about time, it is about saving money."", ""If you're making the same or similar pieces each day, you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made."", 'So, if 10 wood sculptures cost you $100, each sculpture cost you $10 to make (100/10 = 10).', 'This may seem trivial, but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work.', 'At the very least, ensure that you are not losing money on each piece.', 'If you want an organized, productive artistic practice, you need to know about the trends around your work.', ""Keeping organized is about more than just your own studio, it is about understanding the art market you're a part of."", 'Peruse Etsy, visit galleries and show openings, and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices.', ""While it doesn't have a dollar value, make sure you value your time as well as your materials."", ""In the earlier example, don't forget that it cost more than just $10 to make the sculpture."", ""Your hours of work and experience are essential too, so don't sell the piece for $20 if it took you a week to make."", ""While pricing your work is difficult, don't balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for -- not everyone can do what you do, and people are paying for your talent and experience."", ""At the very least, consider what you'd be paid if you used your time otherwise."", 'Twenty hours spent painting could be worth $15 an hour at another job.', 'You should consider this ""missed"" money when pricing work.', 'If you want to make art your living, you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself.', 'Careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off.']"
Create a compelling reel or portfolio. Land an internship. Consider self-employment. Sign on with a design company or studio. Move up to a supervisor position.,How to Be a Visual Effects Artist2,"This should be a short video showcasing the breadth and depth of your skills as an artist. Some choose to follow a storyline format while others cycle through a series of clips. Most college programs will give you time to create this work in your junior or senior years using professional grade equipment and software.Your reel is also a chance for you to showcase any unique skills that you possess, such as drawing or sculpting.Don’t be afraid to work with other artists to create your reel. Showing that you can collaborate well with others is something that studios often look for when hiring.  If you are enrolled in a VFX program, talk to your career counselors to see what opportunities might be available. If you are developing your skills on your own, reach out to studios to see if they have any spots for paid or unpaid interns. This will give a potential employer a chance to get to know you and might make it easier for them to hire you in the future.  Over half of VFX artists are their own bosses. Being a freelance designer gives you more control over your schedule and project selection. But, it also means that you will need to handle administrative tasks and could struggle with bringing in a consistent income.If this path interests you, it would be wise to take a few classes in marketing and accounting. Getting established is a hard struggle that many self-employed artists face.Choosing your own projects can mean that you’ll establish a specialty more quickly than you might in a large studio. However, affording the most recent design equipment may be tough, depending on how successful you are.  This is a more traditional option where you agree to full or part-time employment with an established company. Your work schedule and salary will very much depend on the prominence of the company and the types of projects that come in. However, you may get the opportunity to work on some big Hollywood blockbusters or top-rated television shows!Get your foot in the door of larger companies by serving as a junior 2D artist or runner. A junior artist will assist those with seniority by creating basic outlines for scenery and the like. A runner literally runs sketches and communications between the VFX team and a director, for example.  With enough time, effort, and luck, you may get the chance to take on a leadership position for a project. As a supervisor, the final product that audiences see is your responsibility.

Join a professional society. Enjoy working with a team. Expect long work hours. Spend time on a TV or film set.,How to Be a Visual Effects Artist3,"Networking is a great way to find new opportunities and exchange ideas. Start establishing your network as soon as you decide to become a VFX artist. Join an industry group, such as the Visual Effects Society (VES). If you can’t fully join, then simply follow their activities and attend events when you can.The VES has almost 3,400 members spread across the entire world. Their work ranges from video games to television.  Most VFX work situations will require that you communicate with a number of people as you complete a task. You may need to talk with directors, other VFX artists, and animators to create a unified vision for the final product. Taking communication courses in college is only one way you can learn how to communicate effectively.This also means that you will need to find ways to work with constructive criticism and feedback. Altering your final product based on information from the wider production team is often something that you just have to do. For example, a director might ask you to cut down a scene that you’ve spent weeks working on.Pitching your creative vision and ideas to others is also an important part of the process. If you can make a product more memorable in an advertisement, for instance, then the creative team probably wants to know.  Most VFX artists start work mid-morning and go until the late evening. Or, your shift could be an overnight one that ends in the early morning hours. The schedule very much depends on the deadlines that are looming and how the work is divided over time. You’ll want to be prepared for unpredictable timelines as a VFX artist.Partially due to the long hours, many VFX professionals describe their work setting as being pretty laid back in terms of dress and even behavior.  If you are considering working in the entertainment industry, try to get out of your office and away from your computer and head to the actual sets.

"Make sure you know what is expected of you. Stick to your topic. Don't try to be to be funny unless the scenario calls for it. Act naturally for the situation; talk, act and sit as your character would usually do in the circumstances. Participate. Don't react to what others say as yourself, stay in character. Don't make anything violent or too crazy. Relax and enjoy yourself. Be your character. Play games that allow you to practice improvisation.",How to Be Good at Improvisation,"Some entire movies are improvised, some plays are. Sometimes a group gets together to improvise one scene or find ways to improve a scene. Sometimes a drama lesson can be a while series of different improvised scenes. A class leader may ask everyone to stand and improvise a moonwalk as an ice breaker. You might be put into small groups and given a set time to put together a scene. Improvisation covers a lot! Make sure you know exactly what you have to be good at. , Often in improvisation, you will be given a topic or scenario which determines what, where and who you are. Stay in character. Whoever has decided the scenario, wants to see your interpretation of it, not something completely off topic that you prefer to perform. Keep it appropriate. Don't introduce the fact you have a super power if you are supposed to be showing how to close a sale or pretend the room is starting to flood when you're meant to be being your interpretation of a clock that needs winding.  Yes, some amusing words may get a laugh, but don't lose a good story line by trying to be too funny, unless that's your character. If you work with a partner, don't end up in a comedy contest, trying to be better than your partner.  Focus on your acting; not the audience.  Don't let fear hold you back. It can be scary to stand up in front of a crowd. Take a speech class to practice this and help you get over stage fright.  If someone in your group says, ""I'm the best soccer player ever!"", don't cut him/her off and say, ""Really? I thought you were a gymnast!"" because you know that's what they really do. Remember the rest of the groups is improvising too.  That always ends the show. Being energetic is great, in the right situation, but screaming and shouting or running around excessively just isn't always realistic.  Being nervous can ruin the improvised scene. Relaxing and enjoying yourself can make the audience enjoy you.  Imagine how that character would move, would react, would speak, would think, would feel. Show that in your actions.  There are a lot of improvisation games that were show cased in the popular TV show Who's Line is it Anyway. Research that. Or try other options such acting a scene where everyone who speaks has to include a colour in their sentences. Or you can start a scene and as soon as the actors are in an opportune position, someone says pause, takes a character out, and starts the scene again at a completely different situations inspired by the position of the actors.","['Some entire movies are improvised, some plays are.', 'Sometimes a group gets together to improvise one scene or find ways to improve a scene.', 'Sometimes a drama lesson can be a while series of different improvised scenes.', 'A class leader may ask everyone to stand and improvise a moonwalk as an ice breaker.', 'You might be put into small groups and given a set time to put together a scene.', 'Improvisation covers a lot!', 'Make sure you know exactly what you have to be good at.', ', Often in improvisation, you will be given a topic or scenario which determines what, where and who you are.', 'Stay in character.', 'Whoever has decided the scenario, wants to see your interpretation of it, not something completely off topic that you prefer to perform.', 'Keep it appropriate.', ""Don't introduce the fact you have a super power if you are supposed to be showing how to close a sale or pretend the room is starting to flood when you're meant to be being your interpretation of a clock that needs winding."", ""Yes, some amusing words may get a laugh, but don't lose a good story line by trying to be too funny, unless that's your character."", ""If you work with a partner, don't end up in a comedy contest, trying to be better than your partner."", 'Focus on your acting; not the audience.', ""Don't let fear hold you back."", 'It can be scary to stand up in front of a crowd.', 'Take a speech class to practice this and help you get over stage fright.', 'If someone in your group says, ""I\'m the best soccer player ever!"", don\'t cut him/her off and say, ""Really?', 'I thought you were a gymnast!""', ""because you know that's what they really do."", 'Remember the rest of the groups is improvising too.', 'That always ends the show.', ""Being energetic is great, in the right situation, but screaming and shouting or running around excessively just isn't always realistic."", 'Being nervous can ruin the improvised scene.', 'Relaxing and enjoying yourself can make the audience enjoy you.', 'Imagine how that character would move, would react, would speak, would think, would feel.', 'Show that in your actions.', ""There are a lot of improvisation games that were show cased in the popular TV show Who's Line is it Anyway."", 'Research that.', 'Or try other options such acting a scene where everyone who speaks has to include a colour in their sentences.', 'Or you can start a scene and as soon as the actors are in an opportune position, someone says pause, takes a character out, and starts the scene again at a completely different situations inspired by the position of the actors.']"

They are always looking for people to help make their production a success. They don't pay much (or none at all), so go into it with an open mind and open heart. You’ll get to be part of a production and make connections with others who have a love for theatre.This is a great learning opportunity for someone who is older but looking to break into stage management. Volunteering allows you to work with more experienced people and gain knowledge of the industry.  In order to become a stage manager, it is essential that you know how to do every job in the theatre.

If there are none, ask the person you speak to if they know of any openings.  Middle schools, high school, colleges, and universities usually have theatre departments. Visit all the schools in your area and see if they have any openings for stage managers. This would be a great position for someone who enjoys working with kids. Make sure you are prepared for your visit by dressing professionally and bringing your credentials with you.  Concert halls and other music venues, even outdoor rock and roll shows, also require stage directors. If you can’t find an opening at a theatre, try managing the stage for music productions. Many of the responsibilities, such as overseeing artists and keeping track of show times, will be similar. Plus, you’ll gain experience to add to your resume.  Networking is a great way to find a job. Make connections with other people in the industry, especially from past productions you have worked on. If you show your coworkers that you are dedicated and knowledgeable, they may refer you when they hear of a stage manager position available.Reach out to people you already know in the industry. Ask for recommendations or referrals.Attend as many productions as possible. Stick around after the performance and introduce yourself to members of the cast and crew, when appropriate.  Wearing black is a must in all theaters; it keeps the crew from being too visible on the wings of the stage. Dressing conservatively is a must for all professional jobs, so be sure not to wear anything too showy or revealing -- you want to blend in, not stand out. Invest in several black tops and pants so you will always have a clean supply.  A stage manager is a very demanding job, time-wise. You need to have enough time in your schedule to be early to every single event, whether it be a meeting, rehearsal, dress rehearsal, or a performance. You’ll also need to set up for every event, as well as clean up afterwards.  Stage managers have a lot of people and things to keep track of. You must remain calm, cool, and collected. However, stand your ground when needed to make sure that things are progressing as they should be. Be assertive, but polite to the cast, crew, and guests.Express yourself directly and openly. Don’t be afraid to tell others how you feel, or how you think they are doing in their own roles. Give specific examples of ways they can improve, and be sure to praise them when they follow your advice. Be firm but still friendly.  Guests coming to see the production need to be treated well so they have the best possible experience. Though you will likely be busy with numerous other things, take guest’s requests or complaints seriously and do your best to attend to them.For instance, if someone complains about gum on the floor, assure them it will be taken care of immediately, and then get someone from your crew or the house management crew to clean it up if you are in a tight spot.If someone approaches you during a break in the performance and tells you they are unable to hear the dialogue or music, take steps to rectify the situation. Adjust the audio for that section of the theatre if others in the area are having similar trouble. You could also offer the person another seat in a different section, if possible.  Stage managers are in charge of the entire production, so you must be a good leader for this job. You’ll need to know how to delegate tasks and manage other people. Stage managers must be patient, calm, and level-headed, especially when things go wrong.To be a great leader, you need to be an active listener. When someone is speaking with you, give them your undivided attention and make eye contact. Don’t interrupt or judge them, but do try to understand where they are coming from.Great leaders also take responsibility for their actions. Own up to any mistakes you make, and realize that as the stage manager you will be responsible for mistakes that other people make as well. Make sure someone is able to effectively complete a task before delegating it.  You’ll need to be able to communicate well with a variety of people on the cast and crew. Not only will you be in charge of the stage crew, you’ll also have to communicate with the director, choreographer, and actors. Stage managers also schedule meetings and call times, take notes during meetings, and write up rehearsal reports.Speak clearly and assertively to everyone you encounter. You should also be specific when making requests to others in order to avoid confusion.Body language is also a part of communication. Demonstrate friendliness and approachability by using open body language, such as smiling and angling toward people who are speaking. Avoid frowning, crossing your arms, and fidgeting.  There are many things for a stage manager to take care of and coordinate, so you’ll need to be organized. Keep a notebook for each production to jot down rehearsal and call times, contact info for the cast and crew, blocking notations from the director, etc.Pay attention to the details. You’ll need to keep track of everything from the names of the understudies to the quality of the gel sheets for the stage lights.You can also make to-do lists, set deadlines for tasks, and multitask in order to get everything accomplished on time.","['Theatre classes aren’t just for budding actors.', 'See if your local community college offers classes in touring production, stage lighting, or theatre management.', 'You can also get a degree in stage management, theatre practice, or technical theatre.', 'Whether you take one class or many, you’ll learn invaluable skills and tips for managing a production.', 'To gain valuable experience, volunteer at your local high school, playhouse, or theatre.', 'They are always looking for people to help make their production a success.', ""They don't pay much (or none at all), so go into it with an open mind and open heart."", 'You’ll get to be part of a production and make connections with others who have a love for theatre.', 'This is a great learning opportunity for someone who is older but looking to break into stage management.', 'Volunteering allows you to work with more experienced people and gain knowledge of the industry.', 'In order to become a stage manager, it is essential that you know how to do every job in the theatre.', 'Work on the set, coordinate costumes, help with hair and makeup, become a prop master, assist the director, and learn how to work the rigging, stage lighting, and audio equipment.', 'If you don’t have any theatre experience, try becoming a stagehand or spotlight operator first.', 'You’ll work closely with the stage manager and learn what’s required for that role.', 'Many large companies, like Disney Theatrical Group, offer internships for students.', 'Taking a position like this can help you get your foot in the door and increase your chances of landing a job as a stage manager.', 'Not only will you get to see amazing productions and work with professionals, there is also a chance you could get hired on permanently.', 'Research theatres and playhouses in your area and visit each one.', 'Bring your resume as well as any referrals or letters of recommendation, and inquire about stage management openings.', 'If there are none, ask the person you speak to if they know of any openings.', 'Middle schools, high school, colleges, and universities usually have theatre departments.', 'Visit all the schools in your area and see if they have any openings for stage managers.', 'This would be a great position for someone who enjoys working with kids.', 'Make sure you are prepared for your visit by dressing professionally and bringing your credentials with you.', 'Concert halls and other music venues, even outdoor rock and roll shows, also require stage directors.', 'If you can’t find an opening at a theatre, try managing the stage for music productions.', 'Many of the responsibilities, such as overseeing artists and keeping track of show times, will be similar.', 'Plus, you’ll gain experience to add to your resume.', 'Networking is a great way to find a job.', 'Make connections with other people in the industry, especially from past productions you have worked on.', 'If you show your coworkers that you are dedicated and knowledgeable, they may refer you when they hear of a stage manager position available.', 'Reach out to people you already know in the industry.', 'Ask for recommendations or referrals.', 'Attend as many productions as possible.', 'Stick around after the performance and introduce yourself to members of the cast and crew, when appropriate.', 'Wearing black is a must in all theaters;

"Define the workshop objective. Decide who your audience is. Schedule your workshop for the morning or early afternoon. Publicize your workshop. Recruit 8-15 participants for your workshop. Prepare your participants for the workshop. Prioritize your goals for the workshop. Prepare a variety of teaching aids. Prepare paper handouts. Arrange your audio-visual materials. Organize your computer-based materials. Recruit experts, speakers, and assistants. Decide on your group activities. Leave time for breaks. Resist cramming. Secure catering. Arrive early. Set up all equipment before participants arrive. Arrange the chairs in advance. Distribute materials. Greet participants as they arrive. Introduce yourself and the workshop. Begin icebreakers. Execute your lesson plan. Be flexible. Use interactive exercises to reinforce information. Don't talk too much. Stick to your scheduled breaks. Switch up activities every 20-30 minutes. Lighten the mood. Maintain a respectful, democratic atmosphere. Be prepared for the unexpected. Conclude the workshop with a summary of what they have learned. Get feedback immediately after the session. Follow up with the participants a few days or weeks later. Schedule a follow-up workshop if necessary.",How to Conduct a Workshop,"Whether you are teaching a skill, delivering information or increasing awareness, outline the goals of your workshop. What do you want your workshop participants to learn? This analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching, concrete topics you will cover, or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants. Think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is important.Some examples of workshop objectives include:Learn how to write a persuasive cover letter.Learn how to break bad news to a patient.Learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class.Learn how to create an effective Powerpoint presentation. , Will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers? Will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it? Are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training? Answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshop.For example, if your audience already knows each other, you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly. If they are complete strangers, you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions.  These are the times when participants are most awake and alert.You want your participants to be fully engaged and aware. If you can, avoid scheduling evening workshops after the workday when everyone is tired and impatient.  Pass around flyers, hang up posters, or contact suitable businesses to encourage workshop participation. Having a catchy title helps, as does a brief explanation for why your workshop is important and necessary.Be sure to include images as well as text in your flyers to catch people's attention.  A workshop is not the same as a large lecture. You want your group to be small enough to ask all their questions, practice their skills, and work together. But you also want your workshop to be large enough to keep things interesting. Ideally a workshop will have 8-15 participants.Sometimes you don't have a choice about your group size. If you have a very large group, find creative ways to make sure the size doesn't become overwhelming. For example, a group of 40 participants could be divided into 5 different break-out groups of 8 participants each. You could also bring in co-facilitators and co-presenters to handle groups that are larger than ideal.  Some workshops require that participants do work well before the workshop takes place. Perhaps they have to study journal articles, write a short story, or read one another's work. If your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place, be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning.Be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time. Be clear about where and how your students should submit their work. Will they have to give you hard copies, or will you circulate materials by email?, Most workshops are time-limited. They can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as three days. But no matter what, you will only have a short period of time to impart your knowledge to participants.Rather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time, think about the most important skills, techniques, and information you want your audience to gain. Prioritize those in your lesson plan.  Adults learn in all kinds of ways: visually, orally, through hands-on practice, or any combination of the above.Remember that you might not know your participants' learning styles ahead of time, so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared. Depending on the topic and objective of your workshop, you might want to prepare paper handouts, audio-visual aids, computer-based lesson plans, and role-playing activities.  Readings, case studies, lists of key terms, and quizzes are all possible teaching aids you might wish to prepare. It is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time. That way you can catch typos or errors. Be sure to use a large, easy-to-read font. Give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future.If you have lengthy readings, consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in prepared.If you are handing out numerous documents, consider providing your participants with a folder or binder to keep their papers neat and organized. If you give this workshop often enough, you might even want to compile your materials into a bound book that you give to your attendees.  If you plan to present a slideshow, video clips, or sound clips, you will have to prepare these ahead of time. Test them at home to make sure they are working correctly. Make sure that they are in a format that can be used in your workshop space.It is wise to consult with your venue's a/v technicians to make sure that your materials can be presented properly. Not all projectors are compatible with Macintosh computers, for example. And some rooms might not have sound projection. Make sure that your venue can accommodate whatever technology you wish to use.  If your workshop participants will be expected to complete a computerized quiz or participate in an online discussion forum, you will need to organize these materials ahead of time.Think about whether your participants will have to bring in their own personal computers or devices, and notify them if so.If your participants will be expected to do activities online, be sure to consult with your venue's a/v technician. You will have to make sure that your workshop space is equipped with wireless internet, and you might have to ask for the network's password in advance.  Depending on the topic and size of your workshop, you might want to bring in other team members to facilitate learning. An expert can provide a live demonstration of a new medical technique; a guest speaker might be able to tell a lively anecdote about why your workshop topic is important; and an assistant might be able to help you manage a large group. If you require help from anyone, make sure that you recruit them well ahead of time. The more prepared they are, the better your workshop will be.  Interaction amongst a group of participants sets a workshop apart from other ways of learning. Brainstorm educational group activities that are suitable to your workshop's objectives. Keep in mind that activities can be done in pairs, small groups, or as a full group. Make sure that you include enough opportunities for every workshop participant to contribute meaningfully to your workshop. Some possible group activities include:Debates. Break the workshop into two groups and have each group argue for their position.Think-pair-shares. Ask your participants a discussion question. Have them think about it on their own, discuss their thoughts with a partner, and then share their conclusions with the full group.Question-and-answer sessions. If you have a lot of information to present, include your attendees in the discussion by allowing them to ask questions about the material. You can answer these questions yourself or ask other workshop participants to answer them.Role-playing activities. Assign participants roles to play in order to practice the new techniques they are learning.Brainstorming sessions. Ask your workshop to shout out as many ideas as they can think of. Write them all down on a chalkboard or whiteboard. Then ask your workshop to evaluate what they have come up with.  People are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaks.They are also more likely to remember what they have learned. Schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5-minute break per hour of your workshop. This will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable.  Actual activities can often take 10-20% more time than we estimate.If you think a q-and-a session will last 10 minutes, it might very well last 12 minutes or longer. Build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover. Resist the urge to cram in as much as possible: your participants will feel tired and rushed.If you are worried that your workshop will end early, you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning. If you have time for them, great! And if not, no harm done.  Workshops take a lot of work and energy. Help keep your participants' energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beverages.Ideally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop. You should not have to pay for snacks out-of-pocket.Try to avoid junk foods. Unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon. That will leave your participants bored and tired. Aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit, vegetables, hummus, and whole grain breads.  Leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable in the room. You might have to meet with a/v technicians, caterers, or your team members before your workshop begins as well. Give yourself as much time as you can in case you have to troubleshoot or make last-minute adjustments to your workshop plan.  Computers, laptops, projectors, and speakers will all have to be fine-tuned in advance. After all, you want your workshop time to be productive: you do not want to spend it fiddling with technology. If you can, see if you can have the venue's a/v technician assist you with the set-up. You might not be familiar with the room's technological capabilities, and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently.  The way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group, the size of the room, and the activities you have planned. Ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semi-circle: this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversation.If everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo, perhaps a semi-circle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate.  If you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out, place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop. Make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled. Other materials you might need to set up in your workshop space include:Snacks and beverages.Name-tags and markers.Pens and pencils.  Arriving early allows you to set up, relax and get to know participants before the start of the workshop. This helps in building relationships with the participants.  Once everyone is seated, you will have to orient them to your workshop. Be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you. Give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it. Explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is and why it is important. It is also a good idea to give a rough outline of how the workshop will be run so that they can be prepared. Try to limit this segment to just a couple of minutes.Even if your topic is a serious one, consider using humor to lighten the mood and get everyone comfortable with one another.Explain to your participants what the materials around the room are and what they should do with them. For example, you can ask people to fill out name-tags, grab a cup of coffee, and make sure they have their handouts. If you would rather that your participants not pull out their readings or laptops right away, you can tell them when those materials will be needed.  Ask your participants to introduce themselves. Limit the introductions to a few sentences by asking everyone to answer two or three specific questions, such as their names and what they hope to gain from the workshop. You don't want the icebreakers to go on forever, but it is important that your attendees feel comfortable talking in front of the group.You can also ask everybody to break the ice by answering a light-hearted question like ""What is your favorite movie?"" or ""What is your favorite bad song?"", This is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action. Have your outline in front of you, and try to stick to the outline if you can. Feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why. Your lesson plan doesn't have to be a surprise, and your participants might appreciate being told why you've organized the workshop in the way that you did. For example, you might tell them:""First we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances. After that, we will divide into small groups to determine an ideal solution to the problem.""""We're going to spend some time learning key terms that will be useful to you as you learn this new computer program. After I explain these terms, we'll take a quiz to make sure we are on the same page. After that, we will open things up for discussion.""""Please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you. In a few minutes, you will role-play a counselor-student interaction with your partner."", It is good to have a plan for your workshop, but be prepared to alter your workshop's content based on the reactions and experiences of the participants. Build some flex time into your lesson plan so that you can address their questions, concerns, and interests.You can even provide options for activities that your workshop group can vote on. This will allow you to focus on what really matters and skip over redundant or unnecessary content.  Always follow up the delivery of information with the reinforcement of that information through some kind of group activity. Interactive group work is a particularly effective method to teach problem-solving techniques.A workshop is not the same thing as a lecture, and you want to honor the thoughts and opinions of your workshop participants. Let them teach each other at the same time that you are teaching them. For example, you can:Deliver information in short spurts and then allow participants to ask questions.Divide participants into groups to complete a task and ask them to report back to the entire group.Show a video clip and then ask pairs of participants to discuss their reactions.Provide advice about how to handle a difficult situation and then ask small groups of participants to role-play the scenario.Have an expert demonstrate a technique and then ask your students to take a collaborative quiz about the technique.  You do not want to micromanage every stage of the workshop. Your participants might get bored or annoyed.Keep in mind that a workshop is different from a lecture or a typical meeting: it is a format that thrives on interaction, activity, and group work.  Scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect. Let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks. This allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage, phone calls and other personal needs. Do not skip breaks, even if you are running short on time.  Attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes of the same activity. View this fact as an opportunity for creativity instead of as a problem. Change up your activities, ask your participants to rearrange their chairs, or schedule a break at least once every 20-30 minutes to keep everyone engaged and motivated.  Even if you are treating a serious topic, humor can be a great way to emphasize information and keep everyone attentive.Think about ways that you can introduce humor in a responsible, ethical way into your presentations, discussions, and activities. This will also encourage your participants to remain relaxed, alert, and comfortable.  Make sure that all of your workshop participants are treated equally and respectfully.This means that any leadership roles (such as group discussion leader) should be distributed evenly across the workshop. Encourage quiet, shy participants to speak. You want everyone to feel heard and respected. Similarly, you do not want a single participant's voice (or your own voice for that matter) to dominate the discussion.  Most workshops will run smoothly. After all, the participants presumably want to be there and want to learn. However, there might be scenarios where somebody is unwilling to participate or might be insulting to a colleague. Be professional no matter what, and encourage respectful behavior by modeling respectful behavior.Be clear in what you expect from your participants. If you have a participant who is acting up or trying to bully a colleague, consider speaking privately with that person. Emphasize the importance of what you are teaching, and tell them that you expect adult, professional behavior from them.  Explain everything that your participants have learned over the course of the session.This will help emphasize how far they have come and what new skills they have acquired. Refer explicitly to the objectives you laid out at the beginning of the workshop, and explain how you think the participants have met those objectives. Congratulate your workshop for their hard work and for their new knowledge.  Design an evaluation form that your participants can fill out in the last few minutes of the workshop. Be sure that you leave them with enough time to comment and consider your questions carefully.Immediate feedback not only will help you improve your workshop but will also help reinforce the learning your participants have undertaken.Good questions to ask include:What is the stated objective of this workshop? Did the workshop meet its stated objective?What activities helped your learning the most? The least?Was the workshop an appropriate length?What workshop materials (handouts, readings, quizzes, etc.) were the most useful? Which ones were the least useful?How have you learned or grown from this workshop?How do you think your colleagues have learned or grown?How would you change this workshop in the future? Any suggestions for improvements?Are there any topics that you would like to take a workshop on?, Ask workshop attendees if you may contact them in the future for their input. Some people need time to reflect back on their workshop experiences. Following up with workshop participants several days or weeks later might reveal new insights. You can ask additional questions such as:How well have you retained the information you learned in the workshop?Do you still find yourself thinking about the workshop?How has the workshop helped you at work? Were there ways it could have helped you more?What materials have you found useful since the workshop? What materials have you thrown away or forgotten about?, If enough participants are interested in more advanced versions of your workshop, consider scheduling a Part 2. In the follow-up workshop, you can address more of their questions, dig more deeply into the topic, or engage in more advanced versions of the techniques taught in Part 1. Be sure that your follow-up workshop is not too repetitive and that it is suitable for more advanced attendees.","['Whether you are teaching a skill, delivering information or increasing awareness, outline the goals of your workshop.', 'What do you want your workshop participants to learn?', 'This analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching, concrete topics you will cover, or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants.', 'Think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is important.', 'Some examples of workshop objectives include:Learn how to write a persuasive cover letter.', 'Learn how to break bad news to a patient.', 'Learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class.', 'Learn how to create an effective Powerpoint presentation.', ', Will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers?', 'Will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it?', 'Are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training?', 'Answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshop.', 'For example, if your audience already knows each other, you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly.', 'If they are complete strangers, you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions.',

time to impart your knowledge to participants.', 'Rather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time, think about the most important skills, techniques, and information you want your audience to gain.', 'Prioritize those in your lesson plan.', 'Adults learn in all kinds of ways: visually, orally, through hands-on practice, or any combination of the above.', ""Remember that you might not know your participants' learning styles ahead of time, so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared."", 'Depending on the topic and objective of your workshop, you might want to

wish to prepare.', 'It is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time.', 'That way you can catch typos or errors.', 'Be sure to use a large, easy-to-read font.', 'Give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future.', 'If you have lengthy readings, consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in

are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaks.', 'They are also more likely to remember what they have learned.', 'Schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5-minute break per hour of your workshop.', 'This will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable.', 'Actual activities can often take 10-20% more time than we estimate.', 'If you think a q-and-a session will last 10 minutes, it might very well last 12 minutes or longer.', 'Build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover.', 'Resist the urge to cram in as much as possible: your participants will feel tired and rushed.', 'If you are worried that your workshop will end early, you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning.', 'If you have time for them, great!', 'And if not, no harm done.', 'Workshops take a lot of work and energy.', ""Help keep your participants' energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beverages."", 'Ideally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop.', 'You should not have to pay for snacks out-of-pocket.', 'Try to avoid junk foods.', 'Unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon.', 'That will leave your participants bored and tired.', 'Aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit, vegetables, hummus, and whole grain breads.', 'Leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable

with the room's technological capabilities, and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently."", 'The way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group, the size of the room, and the activities you have planned.', 'Ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semi-circle: this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversation.', 'If everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo, perhaps a semi-circle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate.', 'If you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out, place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop.', 'Make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled.', 'Other materials you might need to

of the workshop.', 'This helps in building relationships with the participants.', 'Once everyone is seated, you will have to orient them to your workshop.', 'Be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you.', 'Give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it.', 'Explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is

""What is your favorite bad song?"", This is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action.', 'Have your outline in front of you, and try to stick to the outline if you can.', 'Feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why.', ""Your lesson plan doesn't have to be a surprise, and your participants might appreciate being told why you've organized the workshop in the way that you did."", 'For example, you might tell them:""First we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances.', 'After that, we will divide into

workshop.', 'Your participants might get bored or annoyed.', 'Keep in mind that a workshop is different from a lecture or a typical meeting: it is a format that thrives on interaction, activity, and group work.', 'Scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect.', 'Let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks.', 'This allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage, phone calls and other personal needs.', 'Do not skip breaks, even if you are running short on time.', 'Attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes

Determine if a fainting spell is approaching. React quickly to the symptoms. Prepare yourself for losing consciousness. Take it slowly if you do faint. Identify the cause. Prevent fainting spells through hydration. Practice calming techniques. Avoid excessive drinking and illegal drugs. Find out if you have a medical condition. Provide the doctor with your history. Follow the doctor's advice.,How to Deal With Fainting Spells,"There are a number of symptoms, referred to as pre-syncope, that you may experience immediately before fainting. Most fainting spells occur when you are standing, and recognizing warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint. In addition, awareness can also help to prevent a fainting episode and will help you stay safe if you do faint.Common symptoms include yawning, a sudden sweat, nausea (sickness), fast and deep breathing, confusion, lightheadedness, blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes, and ringing in your ears. ;, The symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning. If you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct 'antigravity' measures, which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms, can help you avoid a fainting episode.Medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees. These positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a fainting episode. If standing, you can also cross your legs and tightening your abdominal muscles. This is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately. , By preparing, you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint. Try telling someone near you what is happening and ask for assistance, try lying down, or try bracing yourself against a wall to prepare. If you find yourself on stairs or other precarious surroundings, sit down and hold on to a railing immediately.If you do faint, blood flow will resume to your brain naturally and you should regain consciousness in two minutes or less.  It is normal to feel weak and confused for 20 to 30 minutes after fainting. Remain calm when you regain consciousness. Also, take some time to lay on your back to allow blood flow back to the brain. You should also hydrate yourself with water. , Fainting spells are not necessarily an indication of a serious medical condition. In fact, fainting spells may be caused by anxiety, fear, pain, emotional stress, hunger, dehydration, surprise, overexertion, clenching, spasms, choking, or drug and alcohol use. If you suspect that your fainting spells are being caused by one of these issues, there are measures you can take to prevent future episodes.  Hydration is the best way to prevent fainting spells without medication. Drinking more water is ideal, but you can get fluids from food sources (like watermelon), milk, soups, etc. All caffeinated beverages, including sodas, should be eliminated. If you are sufficiently hydrated, you will be urinating regularly and your urine will be clear or light colored, not dark. Caffeine stimulates the heart, making fainting spells more likely to occur. If you drink large amounts of caffeine, you should cut back slowly to avoid headaches.While the amount of fluids you need each day depends on a number of factors — including your level of activity, your climate, your overall health and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should drink about half of your weight in ounces each day. So if you weigh 200 lbs. then you should be consuming 100 oz (or 12.5 8-oz glasses) of fluids each day.If you are an athlete with more muscle-mass, you should drink about two-thirds of your weight in ounces.Eating regularly can also help to reduce lightheadedness and reduce your chance of fainting by boosting blood sugar.  If anxiety and stress are causing fainting spells, calming techniques can help you avoid fainting spells. You can try counting your breaths or deep breathing, flexing and relaxing different muscle groups, and paying attention to the immediate moment rather than the past or future (also known as mindfulness). Avoid placing yourself in stressful situations and do your best to remove yourself from such situations. Learning to stay calm and to assert yourself can help you to overcome feelings of anxiety.  The flushed look that many people get when they drink alcohol is actually blood rushing to the surface of the skin. This takes blood away from the brain, and can cause fainting episodes. Excessive drinking also causes dehydration, which is a leading cause of fainting spells. Illegal drugs, particularly stimulants such as cocaine or ecstasy, also cause fainting spells. These should be avoided.  While it is possible that fainting spells are not related to medical conditions, it is also possible that they are a sign of a medical problem. To determine this, you will need to visit your doctor. You should see your doctor immediately if you experience fainting while exercising, if fainting occurs with rapid heartbeat, or if your family has a history of fainting. If you experience repeated fainting spells, you should consult your doctor. , Your doctor will ask a number of questions to determine the cause of your fainting. These may include the situation you find yourself in when you faint, how long the episodes last, how quickly it takes you to return to normal, and any other symptoms you may experience during the episodes. The doctor may also order a number of tests to determine the cause of your fainting spells.An electrocardiogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects a heart condition is the cause.An electroencephalogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects something in the brain is the cause. , There is a chance that your doctor will not recommend any medication for your fainting spells. There is no medicine that treats fainting spells themselves, so your doctor may instead prescribe a medicine to treat the cause of the fainting spells. These may include medicine for low blood sugar, seizures, anemia, or low blood pressure.If any medications are prescribed, be sure to take them exactly as your doctor advises.","['There are a number

Help with basic hygiene. Watch for bed sores. Look for signs of chest problems. Provide emotional support. Ask about a social worker. Request help from friends and family. Let the professionals help. Acknowledge your emotions. Ask questions. Take care of your spiritual needs. Enjoy what you can. Determine your limitations. Maintain your health.,How to Cope with a Bedridden Parent,"A bedridden person may or may not be able to keep with their own hygiene tasks. If they can't, you or another caregiver will need to help them. Even if they can, you might need to provide them with reminders and the tools to take care of their hygiene. Bathing, dental care, nail care, hair care, and changing clothes are all tasks your parent may need help with. For bathing, you may be able to help your parent into a shower chair (using a wheelchair), where they can mostly bathe themselves with some supervision. On the other hand, they may need a sponge bath.If your parent is completely bedridden, you'll need to bring items to them. For instance, you can bring a toothbrush, a cup with clean water, and a spitting cup over to the bed. Let the person brush their teeth or ask them to open their mouth so you can brush their teeth.Make sure you are helping them trim their nails regularly. They will likely need help with their toenails, even if they don't need help with their fingernails. You'll also need to help the person shave. An electric razor works best for this process, particularly if you've never shaved anyone else. , Being bedridden comes with certain health risks that you need to help watch out for if you're providing care for your parent. For instance, bed sores are a common problem. They generally appear where the person's body touches the mattress, such as the bottom of the feet, the shoulders, the buttocks, and the back of the head.To combat pressure sores, try to change your parent's position every 2 hours, and encourage them to move their body in the bed as much as possible. You can also find special mattresses and cushions that can help relieve pressure points.Pay attention to the sheets. They should be cotton or silk, and you should smooth them out before putting your parent on them, as wrinkled sheets can increase the chance of bed sores.Make sure your parent's skin is moisturized regularly. Also, avoid using scented soaps and talcum powder, as those can dry out the skin. Dry skin makes your parent more susceptible to bed sores. It can also help to make sure your parent is drinking at least 2 liters of fluid a day.On people with darker skin, you may see blue or purple patches, while the patches will be red or white on lighter-skinned people. Cracks, wrinkles, swelling, shiny areas, blisters, and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores. Talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs.  When laying in bed regularly, liquids can build up in the lungs, leading to congestion and even pneumonia. The best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly, preferably every 2 hours.  The emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side. When your parent becomes bedridden, they can't do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularly.Encourage people to come over and visit with your parent, so they have regular interaction.Also, try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible. For instance, if your parent enjoys making art, get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table.It's also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about what's going on. They need a sounding board as much as you do. You can be this person some of the time, but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well. If you are their only source of support, then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on.  Often, a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs. A social worker can benefit you, too, as they can help you find the care you need for your parent, as well as other resources.Most hospitals have social services on site, though you can also visit a Medicare/Medicaid office in your local community, or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through.  When your parent is sick, you may feel like you're alone in the situation. However, more often than not, friends and family would like to help you, but they don't know how. Take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for help.It is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family. Try saying, ""I'm creating a weekly schedule for Mom's care. Please let me know which two days you would like this week.""Offer a specific task if they don't seem to know how to help.If you have children, then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent. Be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times.  If your parent has become bedridden, it's likely you'll need some help from professional caregivers. If you're caring for the person at home, you can get help from people who come to the house. If the person will need long-term care, you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care. If your parent has a terminal illness, hospice care may provide some relief.Both in-home care and care facilities can be expensive. Insurance and medicare may cover some in-home care (which sometimes includes in-home care at senior facilities).Have a talk with your parent about getting some help. They may not like the idea much, as some people are reluctant to have outside help. If you need help persuading them, try asking someone who's been in a similar situation to help. It might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you. You might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead, such as a close friend, a cousin, or a spiritual leader.You can hire whatever level of care you need. For instance, some non-medical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals. However, if your parent needs medical care, you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help, though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor.  When your parent is bedridden, you likely will have a surplus of emotions, which is perfectly normal. You may find you feel anger or resentment. You might feel guilty that you can't spend more time with them or that they're bedridden and you're not. You also may feel anxiety about the situation. Grief is also common, as you've lost who your parent was.Let yourself feel those emotions. Acknowledge them, and give yourself permission to feel them. Also, make sure you find someone to talk to. Anyone with a sympathetic ear will do.Writing down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better. Try keeping a journal as well.You can also talk with others who are facing the same issue. You can join a local support group or find one online. In fact, if your parent is on hospice, many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation. Just knowing you're not alone can help.Professional counseling can also be beneficial. If your parent is bedridden, particularly if they have a terminal illness, it can be difficult to come to terms with that, especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent. A professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with what's happening.  When it comes to a parent's failing health, you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable. When you have questions about your parent's health, ask the doctors and nurses. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to explain it in layperson's terms. You deserve to know what's going on (with your parent's consent, of course).Taking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful. Emotions may be high, which might make it hard for you to remember everything.  Take time to do things you normally do for your spiritual self, such as praying or meditating. These activities can have a calming effect in a stressful situation. Of course, not everyone considers themselves a spiritual person, and that may be the case with you. Nonetheless, it can still help to take a few minutes each day to just be or sit in silence.  When you're taking care of a parent, it can be difficult to find time for yourself to do things you enjoy. However, it's very important to take time each day to relax if you can. It can be something seemingly insignificant, like drawing a little picture or watching the birds outside. Whatever it is, take some time each day to do something you enjoy.Similarly, it's important to maintain the relationships in your life. Try to get away to spend time with people you care about, so you can just be you for a while.At the very least, set aside some time each day to return calls, respond to text messages, or check in with your other loved ones.Also, take time to escape. That is, sometimes, escaping into the fantasy world of a book, movie, or television show can give you the mental break you need. You can even enjoy these with your parent. Listening to your favorite music can also help you take a break.Be sure to schedule this time in. Don’t wait until you feel like you need a break.  When you're providing care, you need to make sure you know what your limits are. Determine how much time you can actually give, as well as how much physical care you can give. Be firm with those limits, and get help as needed.For example, it is important to maintain your relationship with your spouse/partner and children (if you have them). This might mean that certain times of the day will be set aside for spending time with your family, such as dinner time.  When you're caring for someone, it can be easy to neglect your physical health, but it's important to make that a priority, too. Make sure you're eating enough and that you're eating healthy meals with lean protein, whole grains, fruits, and veggies. Try to get some exercise in when you can, as it will lower your stress level and keep you healthy.In addition, make getting enough sleep a priority. Even if you can get enough sleep all at at once, try to work in 7 to 9 hours a day to make sure you'll be able to function.Finally, make sure you are keeping up your regular doctor's appointments and dental care, so that you stay healthy.","['A bedridden person may or may not be able to keep with their own hygiene tasks.', ""If they can't, you or another caregiver will need to help them."", 'Even

Drink more water. Eat breakfast. Eat well throughout the day. Eat at the right times. Consider going meatless. Read the labels. Get in shape. Maintain a healthy weight. Cross train. Exercise wisely. Take the little opportunities. Think positively. Be satisfied. Think small. Manage stress. Choose your friends wisely. Be productive. Take a break. Find emotional balance. Stop engaging in risky behavior. Exercise several times a week. Get a good night's rest. Learn how to cook. Maintain your personal hygiene. Bolster your immune system.,How to Be Healthy,"Adult humans should drink 2-3 litres(or roughly eight 8 oz glasses) of water per day whilst children should drink 1-2 litres ( or roughly five 8 oz glasses.That is in addition to things like tea and coffee. Water keeps bodies at the correct temperature and removes toxins that are the inevitable result of metabolism and industrial life. You'll be healthier automatically.Water also clears your skin, helps your kidneys, helps to control your appetite, and keeps you energized.If being healthier, more wakeful, and having better skin isn't motivation, what is?It also keeps you from drinking unhealthy beverages like soda and juice, which are high in calories. The body barely registers the intake of these unhealthy drinks and yet you still feel thirsty hundreds of calories later. If you need the taste, splash some lemon, lime, or 100% juice into your water. However, be sure that you eat plenty of calcium-rich foods, such as broccoli, to support healthy bones as you grow older. , A light, healthy breakfast is sufficient enough to reap the benefits of eating early. If it's comprised of lean protein and whole grains, then it will keep you from gorging at lunch. Research shows that breakfast-skippers actually eat more! So, to curb your appetite, don't skip the first meal of the day.Instead of two chocolate doughnuts and a coffee that's more cream than anything else, opt for eggs, fruit, and for a beverage, skimmed milk, fresh orange juice, or tea. The healthier your breakfast is, the more energized you'll feel throughout the day and the more you won't need to eat later in the day.  If half of your plate is vegetables and fruit, you're on the right track.Add in lean protein, low-fat dairy, and whole grains. Once a steady eating pattern has been established, your body will feel more comfortable. There may be a period of time when your body is wondering where the sugary foods went, but once you're over the hump, you'll feel better than ever.Remember that not all fats are bad for you. Good fats can be found in oily fish like salmon and tuna, avocados, nuts, and olive oil. These are essential to a well-balanced diet. Read How to Eat Healthy for more tips.  A good time for a healthy, easy-to-digest evening meal is between 17:00 and 20:00; it's best to avoid late night snacks because they fill you with unnecessary calories and can disrupt your sleep. If you do need that midnight snack, stick to unsalted nuts, seeds, fruits, and veggies.Snacking isn't bad for you if you do it right. In fact, eating ""constantly"" can keep you from feeling deprived and going for that third piece of cheesecake when the cart rolls around. Just make sure it's all in moderation.  In case you haven't noticed, meat hasn't played much of a role in what we've talked about so far. Being vegetarian is a good way to reduce your calorie intake and get loads of vitamins and minerals, but that being said, it can be done wrong. While it's not the best idea to go fully vegetarian, most people do eat far too much meat. A good idea is to change the amount and types of meat you eat: swap pork chops for lean chicken; steak for tuna.A high-fiber diet is easily had without meat. Fiber has been shown to lower your cholesterol, control your blood-sugar levels, improve your bowel health, and make you less likely to overeat. The recommended fiber intake is 30g a day for men and 21g for women; after the age of 50, this jumps up to 38g for men and 25g for women. Some good sources of fiber include fruits and vegetables (with the skin), whole grains, and legumes.  Processed foods get a bad rap, and often for good reason. However, you've got to choose your battles. That frozen bag of broccoli isn't nearly as bad as that boxed mac and cheese. In short, avoid processed foods when you can — but if you can't, read the labels and watch for added bad stuff: salt, sugar, and fat.Food that stays on the shelves often has added sodium, words that end in -ose, and trans and saturated fats in the ingredient list. If you see these on the label (especially if they're in high amounts), avoid them. You can find a healthier alternative elsewhere. It's not worth it.Just because it says it has no trans fat doesn't actually mean it has no trans fat. Negligible amounts can be legally ignored — so if you see hydrogenated vegetable oil on the list, you've found one of the masked culprits.  In addition to helping you lose weight and gain confidence, exercising has a host of other benefits for your body and mind. Having good cardiovascular health has been linked to a decreased risk of Alzheimer’s, just to name one. So hit the pool, the pavement, or the park as often as you can.Exercising boosts your immune system too; even a change as minor as walking briskly for 20-30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your immune system by increasing both your antibody and T-killer cell response.Exercising is also one of the absolute best ways to sleep better at night—which can help you lose weight by keeping you from overeating. Read How to Get Fit for more details.  Our physical frames vary in size and weight. An individual with a large frame can carry a little more weight while a person with a light frame will be able to carry less.Being underweight isn't a good thing either! Do not use any form of crash diets. There is no magic bullet for weight loss—and even if there were, starving your body of vital nutrients wouldn’t be it. A slow change in your eating habits is much safer and the long-term benefits for your physical health are greater.If you don't want to go on a diet, read How to Lose Weight Just by Exercising. Just remember that only serious athletes are able to burn off enough calories to be able to enjoy massive indulgences—and even so, they tend not to because it’s hard on the body. Even if you do consume more calories than are recommended for you, be sure that they are nutritious; your heart, brain, muscles, bones, organs, and blood can’t run forever on empty calories.  Just because you can run 5 miles (8.0 km) without stopping doesn't mean you're healthy—same goes for lifting weights the size of a small car. If you only do one activity, you're only using one set of muscles.You'll be shocked when you go swimming or do core workouts that you can't keep up!What's the answer? Cross training. Not only does doing several different activities work all your muscles (which can help prevent injury), it also keeps you from getting bored. That's the ultimate exercise killer! So include aerobic and strength training workouts to your routine. Your muscles will be glad you did.  It should go without saying that there are bad ways to work out. Every time you get moving you put yourself at risk for injury, so make sure you're doing it right!First things first, stay hydrated. You should always be sipping water during your workouts. Getting dehydrated can lead to dizziness or headaches during your sweat session (or lack thereof).Take breaks! It isn't being lazy, it's being healthy. You can't go-go-go forever. After 30 minutes or so of exercise, grab your water bottle and lighten up. Your body needs a second to catch up. You'll be able to go further in the long run.  Being physically active isn't about pounding the pavement or joining a gym—it's a lifestyle that can be had 24/7. If you can add extra 10 steps to your day here and there, they add up.Don't have any ideas? Park a bit farther away from work, the mall entrance, or the grocery store. Ride a bike to work or school. Take the stairs. Walk the dog every day. Take lunch to the park. Bike to work or the local coffee shop. Little opportunities are everywhere.  It's amazing how much power our minds have over everything in our lives. A simple positive twist on a situation can turn an obstacle into an opportunity. Not only will you have more gusto for life, your immune system can fight off colds and heart disease better!Harvard wouldn't lie.To start this difficult step, focus on gratitude. When you start thinking about the bad thing swirling around you, stop. Cut it out. Think of two things you're grateful for. Eventually, your mind will notice the pattern and stop the negativity before you have to consciously do it.  This doesn't mean ""be content with your life"" (well, it does, but give it a sec)—it sort of means ""satisfy yourself"". If you're on a diet, allow yourself a (small) bit of what you're craving. If watching the Golden Girls for three hours on a Friday night sounds like heaven, do it. Whatever the small things are that make you happy, do them.Your happiness is invaluable. If you're not happy, you're not fully healthy. It's when we've got our heads on straight that we can attack everything else. If work, family, friends, a relationship, and money are wearing you down, the choice between that hot pocket and that whole wheat bagel doesn't really matter!, When we concentrate on unattainable goals, we get daunted, frustrated, and lazy.

"Name it!,Make sure your pet always has enough food and water. Keep your pet clean. Train your pet. Care for your pet. Make sure to take it to the vet at least every 6 months.",How to Be a Responsible Pet Parent,"This is a very fun part of having a pet. Choose a name that represents the pet, you, your role model, or just pick a name that you really like. , Depending on the size of your pet, the bowls (Bowls are only used for dogs and cats. Caged pets usually have a bowl of food and a little drip bottle for water.) should be refilled about 2-4 times a day. If your pet is an outside pet, make sure it has a bowl of water outside as well. If you want, you can put a bowl of food outside as well, but it usually gets attacked by some sort of insect(s). If you have a fish, feed it fish food (preferably a tropical kind) about twice a day; once in the morning and once in the evening.Always make sure it has a full bowl of water.  If you have a cat, make sure you have a litterbox, and that the litterbox is always clean. If you have a dog, make sure to let it outside every other hour, or so. Or, and this applies for dogs and cats, you can install a pet door, allowing your pet to go in and out as it pleases. If you have a caged pet, make sure to change out the scraps (newspaper shreds or the cage shavings you can buy at a pet store) frequently. For a fish, clean the filter (if you have one; some fishbowls don't need one) once a month. Also, make sure that the water stays clean.  This part is pretty much geared toward cats and dogs (Any pet that doesn't have to live in a cage or a bowl. It's hard to get a goldfish to shake your hand!). If you want to keep it from doing something, punish it. For dogs, hit it (not smack-hard, but with a little force) on the nose and tell it that was not good, or it's a bad dog. But don't lean in close to it's face or scream at it. Just use a little force in your voice. For cats, tell it it's a bad kitty and hit it on the head. Like I said before, only with a little bit of force. If you want to commend your pet for something, give a treat, and shower it in praise. For example, if you are trying to get your pet to shake your hand, gently grab its paw and shake it, while saying, ""Shake,"" repeatedly. Then, give it a treat and give it many complements. Do this about four or five times, then hold your hand out to it and say, ""Shake."" If your pet automatically puts its paw there, give it a treat and praise it.  Make sure your pet always knows that you love it. Play with it or pet it or, and I know this sounds crazy, talk to it. Tell it it's a good pet.  If it needs any shots, make sure to get the pet its shots right away.If there are any problems with your pet, always go to the vet.

You may also be allowed to give your pet a healthy treat, with the supervision of a parent.Always ask your parents if it’s time to feed the pet before you do it yourself. Your pet may have a strict feeding schedule so they are not overfed or underfed.If you have a pet dog, rabbit, bird or hamster, you should also keep an eye on your pet’s water dish as your pet may end up drinking a lot of water throughout the day. Try to always keep it full with fresh water. If you are younger than 10 years old, you may need help lifting and pouring water into your pet’s water dish. , You can also be a good pet owner by making sure you clean up after your pet. This means picking up any food that falls out of their food bowl and wiping up any water around their water dish so their feeding area is clean. You can also pick up any pet toys and put them in a bin or in one area so they are not scattered all over the house.You may also be able to help your parents clean your pet’s cage or living area. If you have a pet hamster, bird, lizard, or rabbit, you may help your parents remove and replace the newspaper lining in your pet’s cage or help them pick up droppings in the cage. If you have a fish, you may help your parents change out the water in the fish tank so it is clean and fresh.Make sure you always wear gloves or use a tissue to pick up any pet droppings. Wash your hands well after touching your pet’s droppings.  You can also pitch in and groom your pet on a regular basis. Depending on the type of pet you have, this may mean brushing your dog, rabbit, or cat once a day. You may be able to do this on your own or with the supervision of your parents.If you have a dog, you can also make sure your pet gets a bath once a week and stays clean.

Pets that are more social, have medical conditions, or that are used to having lots of interaction with others may not do as well on their own for long periods of time.Also consider your pet's feeding schedule or if your pet likes to get into things and make a mess when you are not around.Younger pets may not be able to handle being left alone as well as more mature pets.If your animal has separation anxiety, a pet-sitter or a boarding house may be a good option. , Two weeks before your vacation, start leaving your pet home alone for longer periods of time. If you usually leave your pet at home while you are away at work, leave your house for a couple of hours after work each day. If you usually see your pet during the day, leave your pet at home while you are at work.This will prepare your pet to spend more time alone.  If you are leaving your pet in someone else's care, it is important that you give him or her enough information to care for your pet.

"Greet your pets. Take special time each day to interact with your pets. Wipe/clean up ""accidents"". Give your pets a safe place to travel.",How to Keep Your Pets Happy,"Even if you have a busy schedule and return home late, make sure to call out to your pets. If you have a dog, he will probably be all over you within seconds of your arrival unless he's busy trying to dig out a bone from his favourite hidden place, your couch.Calling out to your pets generates a positive attitude towards them and they feel less threatened. If you have a lot of pets, call out their names one after the other. Kittens usually do not respond if they are asleep, so you might need to respect that but they will scurry towards you if they suspect cat treats in the grocery bags you just bought in. Remind them that they were missed. , Even 20 minutes will help them feel taken care of. For more active pets, a walk might be a good idea, If your cat has peed on your favourite luggage bag, wipe it clean. There is nothing much you can do about it, except try to take away the pungent smell from the luggage, beds or linen they tend to soil. The very best and most effective cleanser would be bicarbonate soda and/or a little white vinegar. You can try a solution of a little detergent mixed with bicarbonate soda: a few drops of bleach, a tablespoon of vinegar, 5 drops of Dettol, 2 tablespoons of bicarbonate soda and oodles of water. Cats cannot be screamed at, because they simply won't understand. They will know that you are angry for some reason and rubbing their snouts on the soiled area can repeat their behaviour. Carry your cats or kittens to the litter tray and be gentle with them. Soon they will learn.  Dogs love to travel, but only if they get to ride shot-gun, so invest in a proper and spacey carrier box. Kittens like to sneak into dark corners within the car and this can be pretty hazardous if your kittens slip towards the food pedestals. Beware, invest in spacey and cosy carrier box.","['Even if you have a busy schedule and return home late, make sure to call out to your pets.', ""If you have a dog, he will probably be all over you within seconds of your arrival unless he's busy trying to dig out a bone from his favourite hidden place, your couch."", 'Calling out to your pets generates a positive attitude towards them and they feel less threatened.', 'If you have a lot of pets, call out their names one after the other.', 'Kittens usually do not respond if they are asleep, so you might need to respect that but they will scurry towards you if they suspect cat treats in the grocery bags you just bought in.', 'Remind them that they were missed.', ', Even 20 minutes will help them feel taken care of.', 'For more active pets, a walk might be a good idea, If your cat has peed on your favourite luggage bag, wipe it clean.', 'There is nothing much you can do about it, except try to take away the pungent smell from the luggage, beds or linen they tend to soil.', 'The very best and most effective cleanser would be bicarbonate soda and/or a little white vinegar.', 'You can try a solution of a little detergent mixed with bicarbonate soda: a few drops of bleach, a tablespoon of vinegar, 5 drops of Dettol, 2 tablespoons of bicarbonate soda and oodles of water.', ""Cats cannot be screamed at, because they simply won't understand."", 'They will know that you are angry for some reason and rubbing their snouts on the soiled area can repeat their behaviour.', 'Carry your cats or kittens to the litter tray and be gentle with them.', 'Soon they will learn.', 'Dogs love to travel, but only if they get to ride shot-gun, so invest in a proper and spacey carrier box.', 'Kittens like to sneak into dark corners within the car and this can be pretty hazardous if your kittens slip towards the food pedestals.', 'Beware, invest in spacey and cosy carrier box.']"
"Consider time spent caring for your pets. Calculate space requirements for your pets. Make sure you have the ability to care for your pets. Count the number of pets you already have. Create a budget. Consider what you could spend your money on without pets. Make sure all your needs are being met. Pay for medical care. Find out what the rules are. Check city, county, and state laws. Make sure all pets are licensed. Consider any children in the house. Be courteous of others. Be aware of pet hoarding. Find a new home for excess pets. Volunteer or give money to support animal rescue groups or shelters.",How to Know when You Have Too Many Pets,"Cleaning, feeding, grooming, exercising, and ensuring a supply of fresh water is available for your animals takes time. See how long it takes you each day to properly care for all the animals you own. Compare this with the amount of free time you have available after other obligations are met, such as work, school, family time, etc. Make sure you won’t be neglecting another area of your life to care for all your animals.Always remember to take care of your pets. If you don't have time to take care of them all or don't remember which ones you have taken care of that day, you may have to get rid of some of them.Some animal types will require different maintenance. A long-haired dog, for example, probably needs to be brushed daily, while a cat can groom himself. Bird and hamster cages need to be cleaned out and disinfected often, with soiled bedding removed regularly. Be sure to consider the total amount of time you spend on all caretaking tasks for each animal you own each day, week, and month.The amount of free time you have available and are willing to spend caring for pets will determine how much time you spend with them. However, if it takes over two to three hours to take care of all your animals every day, then you may already have too many pets. , Consider what your living arrangements are —how large is the living area and yard space you have for your animals? If you live in a small upstairs apartment without a yard, then take that into account when thinking about how many animals you can house. If you live out in the country on several acres, then you can probably keep more animals. Remember that each animal needs to have enough room to walk around and not be in a cramped space.While space definitely needs to be considered so that everyone can live together comfortably, time is the more important factor here. If you have the time to walk your dogs, then providing a large area to run in is not as important as making sure you can take them for walks every day to meet their exercise needs.  Your health status is an important factor to consider when getting more pets. Be aware of what you can and cannot handle without assistance. If you have difficulty getting around on your own, another pet may not be the best idea.Also, consider your mental health status. Depression can make it very difficult to care for yourself as well as pets. Your animals rely on you, so not taking on more than you can handle is very important for everyone’s wellbeing.Animals can cause stress and contribute to mental health problems, such as anxiety. You are responsible for your pets. The more animals you have, the more their needs, health issues and behavior can weigh on you.  Though the number of pets you have can give you an idea of whether you already have a lot, the resources that you have available are more important than the actual number of animals you own.You need to be able to care for and provide an enriching environment for all your animals so that they can be happy and bring you joy as companions instead of more life stress.Consider what species of animals you have as well as individual temperaments and group sexual dynamics before getting another pet.Overcrowding may have a negative effect on the pets you already have. For example, it's recognized that in household with five cats or more there is a high likelihood of inappropriate spraying in order to mark territory. This is because the cats view the presence of other cats as a threat. The more cats, the bigger the perceived threat. So consider whether or not it's fair to take on another pet if it adds to the stress of your existing pets.If you can't count all your pets, or lose count, you have too many pets and shouldn’t get any more.While some people may look down on a person with 10 cats, as long as the owner can provide a sanitary place to live, afford medical care and emergency services for each cat as well as meet their own needs and pay bills, then there isn’t a problem.The pack mentality can increase as you get more dogs, and this can cause more behavioral problems because the social dynamics become more complex and your ability to give attention to each animal is lessened.Mixing male and female animals can increase competition. Hormones, territorial tendencies, and breeding behavior all contribute to problems you will have to deal with. Keep this in mind before adding new pets to the ones you already have.  Write down your expected expenses and income for the month. Use bank statements, receipts, and bills to help determine what you’re spending every month. Include your house or rent payment, car payments, insurance, groceries, gas, utilities, and other spending. Be sure to include all the expenses related to your pets, such as food, grooming, toys, bedding, supplies, medications, and healthcare costs.Doing this will allow you to see how much you are spending on your pets every month. Consider how adding another pet will change these numbers. Is it something you still want to do?, Looking at the numbers, what could you afford if you didn’t have so many pets? Look at yearling savings as well as monthly. This can really show you whether another pet is worth it or not.If you didn’t have pets, could you increase your entertainment costs or pay for a car? Could you take that trip you’ve been wanting to take? Now, think about the monthly and yearly costs associated with getting another pet. What will you have to cut out of your budget and lose?, Don’t skip meals to pay for your cats’ litter. Make sure you get the nutrition you need and can pay your bills on time. If you’re regularly making late rent payments or not going to the doctor so you can buy your dogs’ food, then you probably don’t need another pet.  Medical care for animals can be expensive — sometimes thousands of dollars a visit. You’ll want to be able to save up money regularly in case you need to pay for emergency care or buy prescription medications for your animals. You need to be financially prepared for each animal that you own.Keep up to date with shots. Many young animals need a series of vaccinations the first year and regular rabies vaccinations after that.If you have multiple animals, pet insurance may be a good option. Be sure you can make your payments every month and pay any remaining balances for each pet.  Your apartment or neighborhood may have rules that dictate the size, breed, and number of animals you can have. Check your lease, talk to your landlord or your neighborhood association to find out if there is a limit to how many animals you can keep on your property.  Your local animal control and zoning laws probably dictate how many animals you can keep on your property. Governing bodies do this in order to prevent unsanitary, unhealthy conditions for residents. You will want to call animal control or talk to your city or county administrative office to find out what the local laws are so you can remain in compliance.Pet hoarding, or having too many pets than you can take care of, is likely in violation of your state, city, county, or other local health and zoning laws. You could lose your pets and even your house.  Many cities and counties require animals to be registered and licensed. In order to license pets, the pet often has to be spayed or neutered (or a breeder license purchased) and all shots be up to date. You can be fined or jailed if you do not have all your pets legally licensed.  Because you are responsible for your pets and your children, having too many pets can compromise your ability to care for your children. If you can’t keep your property and home clean or neglect your animals, you can be charged with child neglect or endangerment as well. Make sure your children are taken care of before you consider getting anymore pets.  The more animals you have, the more odors and noise they create. Don’t get so many pets that your neighbors start complaining. The size of your residence will play a factor in this as well — an apartment is going to be right next to another apartment, whereas you probably have some space between houses.Many apartments and cities have noise ordinances. Check with yours to make sure that adding another barking dog won’t be a problem.  Some people have a mental illness that causes them to have more than the typical number of pets. They are unable to meet minimal care requirements and cannot recognize that they have a problem — even when animals become ill or die. You will need to contact your local police or health department or humane society if you or someone you know suffers from this condition.The unsanitary conditions of pet hoarding also negatively affect the community by increasing the risk of fire, creating poor air quality, attracting pests, and encouraging the transmission of infectious diseases. It is in your best interest to report suspected pet hoarding cases.When animals do not have access to enough food, live in unhygienic conditions or don’t get medical care, it’s considered to be animal cruelty.If you suspect you may be a pet hoarder, seek professional help right away.  If you find that you can’t support the pets you have or take care of them, then you need to give up some of them. You and your animals all deserve to have a good quality of life. If you can no longer give them the attention, time, space, or provide the food or medical care that they need, you must allow them a chance to get the care they deserve with someone else.Friends, family members, and co-workers might be able to take one off your hands. If not, there are many rescue groups, shelters, and animal sanctuaries that can help.Put an add up in your local paper, at a local pet shop, feed store, or on an online site like craigslist.com for the animals you need to give up.  If you can no longer take care of extra animals, you can still help out in other ways. Support documented 501(c)(3) corporations with a reputation for providing high-quality animal care however you can. Your local shelter can always use your help as well.","['Cleaning, feeding, grooming, exercising, and ensuring a supply of fresh water is available for your animals takes time.', 'See how long it

Budget enough money for adequate care. Schedule regular visits to the vet. Make sure your new ""family member"" has food that suits their nutritional needs. Give your pet your affection and attention. Clean your pet and all of its enclosures. Do in-depth research about care for your pet.",How to Take Care of Your Pet,"While pets are loving additions to your home, they are not always easy to manage. All pets require time, money, and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed. You need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the long-term.Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day, so make sure you'll be home enough to take care of your pet.If you have kids, consider what pets will be kid friendly. Hamsters and fish, for example, make great early pets.If you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldn't consider a pet until you are more stable. ;, Even different types of dogs have different needs, so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means. Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like. Don't go into this decision dead-set on one species or breed -- being open-minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family. Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets:Dogs - though dogs vary widely by breed, all dogs need lots of attention, time to exercise, and plenty of room to roam.Cats - Intelligent and individual, cats will be fine with less supervision, though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out..Hamsters, Gerbils, Ferrets, and Rodents - Economical and short-living, rodents make good first pets. They often, however, have strong odors.Fish - Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive, and won't cuddle anytime soon. Think of having a fish like having a garden.Lizards - Happy on their own and generally easy to care for, lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick.Birds - Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud. They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental, especially bigger birds like parrots.  Curious, food-driven, and unable to listen to your warnings, pets can get into trouble if you don't create boundaries or safe spaces. Birds may dart out of open windows, lizards can scamper around the house, and dogs or cats may run into the street. Take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach.Remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food.If you want your animal to have outside time, consider putting in a fence.Put aside one room that you can designate as the pet's ""bedroom.""Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other.  Talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things you'll need -- housing, toys, grooming supplies, etc. -- and shop before you bring your new pet home. Teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page.If you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by ""feeding"" a doll or regularly watering plants.  Pets are not ultra expensive, but that doesn't mean you won't need to spend money. Below are some annual cost estimates provided by the ASPCA:Dogs-- $600-$900, depending on sizeCats-- $600Rabbit-- $700Rodents--$300-$650, depending on sizeFish -- $40 Small Birds -- $400Large Birds (Parrots, Macaws)-- $700-$1,200 Set aside a few hundred dollars in case of emergency veterinary costs.  Be sure to bring your pet to the vet soon after adopting it as well. Just like humans, pets need regular check-ups to spot problems before they become serious conditions. Use your first visit to discuss how often you should schedule check-ups and your pet's dietary and medical needs.Be sure to schedule shots and vaccinations as soon as you can.Ask your vet what symptoms to look for if your pet gets sick.Spay or neuter dogs and cats to prevent pet over-population. Record your vet's number as well as the number of a veterinary hospital in case of emergencies.  The cheapest food you find may not always be the healthiest.

Only feed your pet appropriate foods and give them responsible portions.Research or ask your vet about good food sources and portion sizes.Natural foods, though more expensive, are healthier than dry or processed foods. , Though this is certainly true of dogs and cats, even fish and lizards require dedication and love to really thrive. Animals are social beings much like humans, and you need to set aside time to play with your pets so they get exercise and mental stimulation.Give your pet room to roam -- the bigger the animal, the more room they'll need.Buy toys and play-sets for you and your pet to use together.Give your pet the occasional treat after good behavior to motivate it and cement good habits.  This will keep both you and your pet healthy and happy. Create a regular cleaning schedule, at least once every 2-3 weeks, and stick to it, cleaning your animal and it's living spaces to prevent disease and odor.For larger pets like cats and dogs, there are animal cleaning centers with large tubs and hoses.Keep up with regular grooming, such as brushing fur or scrubbing scales, every few days.For dogs and cats, make sure you keep their nails short so they don't break painfully. , While these steps are general guidelines for pet ownership, each animal is different and you need to adapt accordingly.

"Research the type of pet, so you can make sure the pet fits into your environment and lifestyle. Choose your breed carefully, especially if you have children. Be realistic about your budget, and your ability to shoulder responsibilities. Exercise your pet if it’s the kind of pet that needs it, such as a dog. Watch your pet’s diet carefully. Consider whether your pet needs to be groomed. Monitor your pet for illness and injury. Train your pet if it’s the kind of pet that needs it. Make time for your pet. Love your pet.",How to Take Care of a Pet,"It is critical that you do adequate research before buying the pet. Different animals have different needs regarding care (for example, tropical fish cannot be treated the same way as cold water fish), and even within the same species, different breeds can have different needs.If you are buying a dog, then buying a high energy, large breed such as a wolfhound would be unsuitable if you live in a small apartment or spend all day at work and have nowhere to let the dog roam in the day. Focus on the pet's needs, not your wants.If you want an animal like a snake instead, research is still important. It is critical that the snake has enough space to crawl around in and a heat source (such as a lightbulb).If you're leading an active life, choose a dog. If you are away from home a lot, though, choose a cat or some other free-roaming animal. If you just want an animal to look at and don't want to interact with it directly, or don't have lots of time, choose a fish or a snake, or other creepy-crawlies. , It’s a mistake to just decide “I want a dog” (or any other animal) and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed.Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood. This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the ""herd,"" the collie will try to get it back. How does it do it with the sheep? It bites them. This may result in grave injuries to children. Please do your research on how breeds behave.It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs. Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs. For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter.For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room. If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out.  Some pets are more expensive than other pets, and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it.Costs associated with pets include set-up supplies. Depending on the kind of pet, you might need a crate, an aquarium, and leashes.Don’t forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet. You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases, but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care (like shots), not just emergency care. That's essential to keep the pet healthy, and it can be quite costly.  Figure out the exercise needs (if any) of the pet before you buy it, and consider whether your lifestyle gives you enough time to meet them.Some pets don't require you to do much beyond providing them with a safe place to move about, such as buying a run for a rabbit, and making sure the tank is large enough for fish. But other pets must be exercised.Dogs require a more hands-on approach to exercise because they need to be walked regularly. Making sure your pet gets enough exercise can help prevent aggression and destructive behaviors.  Many foods that are edible for humans can be inappropriate for animals, making them ill when they consume them, so it is important to research what foods your pet can not eat as well as those they can eat.Overfeeding is as harmful as underfeeding, so it is important that your pet gets the amount of food it needs and not too much extra. For some animals, dietary requirements may change with the season; for example, if you have horses or other grazing animals, they will often require more hay during the seasons when there is less grass.Look at pet food labels to make sure you are purchasing food for your pet that is properly nutritious. Research which food could harm your pet.It is vital that all pets have a constant water supply. Check water bowls at least once a day to ensure that they have enough water and that the water is clean and not contaminated.  Many animals will largely take care of themselves, only really needing to be groomed or bathed when they manage to get very messy. Others, such as long-haired dogs or cats, may need regular grooming.It is a good idea to desensitize your pet to being groomed or bathed from an early age. When brushing fur, ensure any brush used on the face is soft, and if brushing long, tangled fur, take the time to work out knots gently rather than tugging. You can buy brushes for pets at pet stores.When bathing your pet, make sure that the water is lukewarm and that the products you use do not cause an allergic reaction - buying specialist shampoos is not always necessary, but heavily perfumed products may cause a rash for many animals.Consider taking your pet to a professional groomer if you aren’t sure you are competent to do it. You don’t want to accidentally injure the pet.  As pets cannot tell us when they are ill or injured, it is up to us to keep an eye on them and look out for any signs of injury.Knowing your pet's normal behavior is very important; if they are sick or injured, they will often act unusually, such as sleeping more, going off their food, etc. If they begin to act oddly, check them for any injuries and keep an eye on their food and water intake; if they stop eating or drinking, or they have obvious wounds that are concerning you, then take them to the vet.Make sure that your pet has all of the proper vaccines and other preventative medication suggested by your veterinarian, such as heart worm pills for some dogs.  A major part of caring for a pet is training. Training is essential for the safety of the animal and the people who interact with it.If you have an apartment cat, the litter box is very important from the start. You have to teach your cat to use the litter box and to think of it as its only place to do the necessary business.The litter box needs frequent cleaning (once or twice a day, depending on the cat).Feeding is approximately 2 or 3 times a day, again, depending on the cat. Water should be supplied continuously.Dogs need to be trained so they understand proper behavior, such as where to go to the bathroom and not to jump on people when they enter the house. It’s important that the owner establishes control, but never in an abusive or harmful way to the animal.  Some animals require more attention than others, so the amount of time they need is often relative. Just be sure than you are capable of fulfilling whatever that need may be.Try to take a little time out of each day to spend with your pet, even if it's just sitting down with them. More often than not, your pet would be more than happy to relax with you.Dogs should be walked, and hamsters need time to run around in their balls.Play should be fun for both your pet and you, but make sure it is safe and monitored at all times.Research whether your pet breed needs to socialize with other animals. Play with it - dogs are very social animals so they need to spend time with their owners. With toys or simply chasing him around is enough for exercising. Dogs have a natural craving for chewing things, so buy a chewing toy to keep him entertained.  Love is what your relationship with your pet has to be about. Show him or her your affection by petting and playing.Your pet will be a member of your family, so treat it like one. A good cuddle will do the both of you good. Pets respond to the tone of people's voices as well as touch.Horses need attention. Like wild horses, if you don't love them properly, they pretty much turn into mustang. Give them a treat once in a while, take a walk with them, or ride them for fun.Train a pet with positive reinforcement, never cruelty or abuse.Keep your pet and its environment clean.If you have a small animal, clean their cage weekly. You're not showing your pet love if you let it sit in filth. If you have a dog, vacuum fur regularly from the house and wash their dog bed from time to time. Neglecting to clean your pet could result in infection, so keep on top of its cleanliness!","['It is critical that you do adequate research before buying the pet.', 'Different animals have different needs regarding care (for example, tropical fish cannot be treated the same way as cold water fish), and even within the same species, different breeds can have different needs.', 'If you are buying a dog, then buying a high energy, large breed such as a wolfhound would be unsuitable if you live in a small apartment or spend all day at work and have nowhere to let the dog roam in the day.', ""Focus on the pet's needs, not your wants."", 'If you want an animal like a snake instead, research is still important.', ""It is critical that the snake has enough space to crawl around in and a heat source (such as a lightbulb).If you're leading an active life, choose a dog."", 'If you are away from home a lot, though, choose a cat or some other free-roaming animal.', ""If you just want an animal to look at and don't want to interact with it directly, or don't have lots of time, choose a fish or a snake, or other creepy-crawlies."", ', It’s a mistake to just decide “I want a dog” (or any other animal) and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed.', 'Some breeds are natural shepherds, which makes them great for 1 person, but some breeds (Border Collie, for example) have the sheep-herding instinct in their blood.', 'This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the ""herd,"" the collie will try to get it back.', 'How does it do it with the sheep?', 'It bites them.', 'This may result in grave injuries to children.', 'Please do your research on how breeds behave.', 'It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable, safe and provided with what it needs.', 'Some animals are very adaptable, such as cats, which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers, while others have more specific needs.', 'For example, horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter.', 'For animals that will roam the house, not being confined to tanks or cages, they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic, where they can lie without being disturbed, such as the corner of a room.', 'If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors, then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out.', 'Some pets are more expensive than other pets, and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it.', 'Costs associated with pets include set-up supplies.', 'Depending on the kind of pet, you might need a crate, an aquarium, and leashes.', 'Don’t forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet.', 'You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases, but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care (like shots), not just emergency care.', ""That's essential to keep the pet healthy, and it can be quite costly."", 'Figure out the exercise needs (if any) of the pet before you buy it, and consider whether your lifestyle gives you enough time to meet them.', ""Some pets don't require you to do much beyond providing them with a safe place to move about, such as buying a run for a rabbit, and making sure the tank is large enough for fish."", 'But other pets must be exercised.', 'Dogs require a more hands-on approach to exercise because they need to be walked regularly.', 'Making sure your pet gets enough exercise can help prevent aggression and destructive behaviors.', 'Many foods that are edible for humans can be inappropriate for animals, making them ill when they consume them, so it is important to research what foods your pet can not eat as well as those they can eat.', 'Overfeeding is as harmful as underfeeding, so it is important that your pet gets the amount of food it needs and not too much extra.', 'For some animals, dietary requirements may change with the season;

"Create a proper training environment. Be prepared. Start early, train often, but don’t push too hard. Have it eating out of your hand. Shape the desired behaviors. Get your clicks. Stay on target. Employ the “step up” as an early training step. Test the most basic method. Use an alternate treat-based step-up. Move on to the target-training step-up. Don’t presume your parrot will (or won’t) talk. Watch your mouth. Start young and stay calm. Repeat, and repeat again.",How to Train a Parrot,"Think about how you would want to teach a small child. If they feel safe, calm, comfortable, and alert, they are more likely to take instruction effectively. The same is true for your parrot.Find a quiet space where you and your avian student can focus on the task at hand. Choose somewhere familiar to the bird so it will already have a level of comfort before training starts.Don’t try to train when the parrot is overly agitated. Wait for a calmer moment. However, training with treats works best when the bird is hungry, so training before mealtime is usually the best scenario. , While parrots are often quite friendly and caring, they are not in general known for being overly patient. Delays and mistakes during training sessions may not go over well, so preparation beforehand is important.Gather up the supplies you will need for they type of training you will be conducting. These might include items like a hand-held perch, a towel, a clicker (if “clicker training”), a chopstick or drumstick (if “target training”), a leash/harness (if taking training outdoors), bitter apple spray (to make common areas of parrot nibbling like draperies unappealing), and, of course, treats.Choose a treat that your parrot especially enjoys, and also that you can easily feed to your bird. Thin apple wedges, for example, can make a good hand treat for a parrot.  We’ve all heard that old dogs have trouble learning new tricks, and the same principle holds true for just about any animal, including parrots (and people, for that matter!).Begin the process of training your bird as soon as possible. So long as your parrot has reached the point of being capable (if not yet entirely willing) to eat a treat from your hand, you can begin training.Hold multiple training sessions during the day, ideally at similar times each day for consistency, but more importantly when the parrot is in the mood for learning (that is, calm).However, keep the sessions relatively short — no longer than fifteen minutes at a time. Once your bird begins to lose interest, it is best to end the session and begin again another time.  Rewarding your bird with a treat from your hand is essential to practically every type of parrot training out there. It also helps establish a bond between you and a new and/or young parrot.Start the process with the parrot inside its cage. Slowly approach and present the treat. Stay calm and offer only encouraging approval when the bird eventually takes the treat.Apple slices, again, make a good treat option if you’re worried about having your fingers nibbled upon. You can also wear gloves, if you so choose, though your bird may find those even more appealing to peck at.  “Shaping” is a training ideology that focuses upon rewarding the bird for approximations, and eventually deliberate acting, of the steps required to complete a training task.Shaping is well-named, for it is all about molding behaviors through positive reinforcement.As one example, if you were teaching your parrot to bathe itself in a small water dish, you would reward the bird for (among several other intermediary steps) looking toward the dish, looking at the dish, moving toward the dish, moving to the dish, testing the water, stepping into the water, and eventually splashing around.  Pets ranging from birds to cats can often benefit from “clicker training,” which involves using a hand-held clicking device (think of the sound a pen clicker or metal juice-bottle cap makes) to indicate proper behavior worthy of a reward.The “click” serves as an audible cue that an appropriate response has occurred, and should occur immediately upon said response and be accompanied immediately by a reward. Thus, you may hear the phrase “click and treat” to describe what is essentially a single maneuver.For instance, if using a clicker during “step up training” — as detailed elsewhere in this article — the “click and treat” would occur immediately upon the parrot stepping up onto your finger/hand. Clicking can be incorporated into virtually any training program.  Another training option, which can be used in combination with a clicker if desired, is known as “target training.” It uses a bird’s natural curiosity in investigating new objects to build a reliable response.In a basic version of target training, a chopstick, drumstick, or other wooden wand is pointed in the vicinity of the parrot, and any contact with the tip is immediately rewarded with a treat (or “click and treat,” if desired). Slowly, over time, the parrot will learn to follow the target throughout the cage and around the room, in the process learning to obey a simple command prompt.Target training builds a key basic skill, therefore, that serves as a gateway to more specific training.  As the name indicates, this skill involves your bird learning to step or hop from one perch to another as directed, with the target perch usually your hand, finger, or hand-held perch (such as a dowel rod).The step up is an ideal skill to teach early on for several reasons:It is relatively easy to master for both teacher and student.It derives from a natural parrot behavior, the desire to move from perch to perch.It is practical, as having your bird hop into your hand on command makes everything from playtime to cage-cleaning easier.It leads into other, more detailed skills as a basic maneuver.While the step up is a simple skill, there are numerous training methods of varying complexity from which to choose, a few of which are described in the following steps.  If your new bird has some prior training experience or just a natural inclination, the simplest training option may be sufficient.Offer your finger or wrist to your parrot (depending on the bird’s size and your preference), placing it in front of the bird at mid-breast level. Many birds will naturally step up onto the new perch without any coaching at all.Create a cue for the behavior, either by saying “step up” or employing a clicker simultaneous to the parrot making its move. Reward the bird immediately as well.If the bird does not step up unprompted, employ “shaping” and reward incremental behaviors, such as touching the perch with the beak, placing one foot on the perch, etc.  In this method, you use the treat more as a lure to coax the desired behavior, but the basic training principles are quite similar.Hold the treat in one hand, and offer the other hand/finger to the bird at chest level. Orient your hands so that the easiest way for the parrot to reach the treat is by stepping up onto the offered perch.If your bird does not immediately step up, reward any contact with the offered perch at first, and incrementally reward only the desired step-up behavior.If you’re handy enough with the clicker to use it while both hands are occupied, it can be incorporated, and/or a verbal cue like saying “step up.”, If other methods have been less successful, or you have been utilizing target training already, you can teach the step-up by employing the familiar target and reward system.Hold your familiar target — a wooden drumstick, for instance — in one hand, and your desired perch (your finger, hand, or hand-held perch) in the other. Alternatively, if your manual dexterity is up to the task, you can do both with one hand, which leaves the other for holding treats, a clicker, etc.Locate the target so that it directs the bird to the new perch, which should be located in the common step-up position at the bird’s chest.Immediately reward positive behavior, and use the clicker or a verbal cue if desired. Eventually, the target will no longer be required to prompt the behavior.  Especially for people new to parrot ownership, talking is usually the first skill they think of teaching and of which they presume their bird will be able to master.The truth of the matter is, every parrot is different, and you should never acquire a bird — even of a breed known for talking — with the assumption that it will talk.  Some parrots will require little or no training to learn to talk, and may in fact pick up words and phrases you’d prefer they not repeat.Excited utterances — such as things you might shout at the TV during a sporting event — are often more readily picked up by a parrot, and they’re listening more often than you may think. So be careful what you say around them!, Parrots talk to other members of their flock, and it is easier to establish yourself as part of your bird's flock early in its life. Therefore, you are more likely to have success when starting with a baby bird.Use a clear, calm, happy voice to repeat a simple word or phrase as you start the training process. Think about how you would try to teach a human child to say ""Mommy.""Early in the process, reward any sound, then any approximately accurate sound, and eventually a recognizable sound with an immediate treat.  Repetition is the key element of training a parrot to talk. Simply put, the more times you say a word or phrase around a parrot, the more likely it is to pick it up and repeat it.Train as often as you like. Parrots will not tire of conversing with another member of their flock, although you may.Some experts recommend recording yourself saying a phrase and playing it back on a loop for the bird.Of course, by using this method you lose the personal interaction between the two of you.","['Think about how you would want to teach a small child.', 'If they feel safe, calm, comfortable, and alert, they are

outdoors), bitter apple spray (to make common areas of parrot nibbling like draperies unappealing), and, of course, treats.', 'Choose a treat that your parrot especially enjoys, and also that you can easily feed to your bird.', 'Thin apple wedges, for example, can make a good hand treat for a parrot.', 'We’ve all heard that old dogs have trouble learning new tricks, and the same principle holds true for just about any animal, including parrots (and people, for that matter!).Begin the process of training your bird as soon as possible.', 'So long as your parrot has reached the point of being capable (if not yet entirely willing) to eat a treat from your hand, you can begin training.', 'Hold multiple training sessions during the day, ideally at similar times each day for consistency, but more importantly when the parrot is in the mood for learning (that is, calm).However, keep the sessions relatively short — no longer than fifteen minutes at a time.', 'Once your bird begins to lose interest, it is best to end the session and begin again another time.', 'Rewarding your bird with a treat from your hand is essential to practically every type of parrot training out there.', 'It also helps establish a bond between you and a new and/or young parrot.', 'Start the process with the parrot inside its cage.', 'Slowly approach and present the treat.', 'Stay calm and offer only encouraging approval when the bird eventually takes the treat.', 'Apple slices, again, make a good treat option if you’re worried about having your fingers nibbled upon.', 'You can also wear gloves, if you so choose, though your bird may find those even more appealing to peck at.', '“Shaping” is a training ideology that focuses upon rewarding the bird for approximations, and eventually deliberate acting, of the steps required to complete a training task.', 'Shaping is well-named, for it is all about molding behaviors through positive reinforcement.', 'As one example, if you were teaching your parrot to bathe itself in a small water dish, you would reward the bird for (among several other intermediary steps) looking toward the dish, looking at the dish, moving toward the dish, moving to the dish, testing the water, stepping into the water, and eventually splashing around.', 'Pets ranging from birds to cats can often benefit from “clicker training,” which involves using a hand-held clicking device (think of the sound a pen clicker or metal juice-bottle cap makes) to indicate proper behavior worthy of a reward.', 'The “click” serves as an audible cue that an appropriate response has occurred, and should occur immediately upon said response and be accompanied immediately by a reward.', 'Thus, you may hear the phrase “click and treat” to describe what is essentially a single maneuver.', 'For instance, if using a clicker during “step up training” — as detailed elsewhere in this article — the “click and treat” would occur immediately upon the parrot stepping up onto your finger/hand.', 'Clicking can be incorporated into virtually any training program.', 'Another training option, which can be used in combination with a clicker if desired, is known as “target training.”', 'It uses a bird’s natural curiosity in investigating new objects to build a reliable response.', 'In a basic version of target training, a chopstick, drumstick, or other wooden wand is pointed in the vicinity of the parrot, and any contact with the tip is immediately rewarded with a treat (or “click and treat,” if desired).', 'Slowly, over time, the parrot will learn to follow the target throughout the cage and around the room, in the process learning to obey a simple command prompt.', 'Target training builds a key basic skill, therefore, that serves as a gateway to more specific training.', 'As the name indicates, this skill involves your bird learning to step or hop from one perch to another as directed, with the target perch usually your hand, finger, or hand-held perch (such as a dowel rod).The step up is an ideal skill to teach early on for several reasons:It is relatively easy to master for both teacher and student.', 'It derives from a natural parrot behavior, the desire to move from perch to perch.', 'It is practical, as having your bird hop into your hand on command makes everything from playtime to cage-cleaning easier.', 'It leads into other, more detailed skills as a basic maneuver.', 'While the step up is a simple skill, there are numerous training methods of varying complexity from which to choose, a few of which are described in the following steps.', 'If your new bird has some prior training experience or just a natural inclination, the simplest training option may be sufficient.', 'Offer your finger or wrist to your parrot (depending on the bird’s size and your preference), placing it in front of the bird at mid-breast level.', 'Many birds will naturally step up onto the new perch without any coaching at all.', 'Create a cue for the behavior, either by saying “step up” or employing a clicker simultaneous to the parrot making its move.', 'Reward the bird immediately as well.', 'If the bird does not step up unprompted, employ “shaping” and reward incremental behaviors, such as touching the perch with the beak, placing one foot on the perch, etc.', 'In this method, you use the treat more as a lure to coax the desired behavior, but the basic training principles are quite similar.', 'Hold the treat in one hand, and offer the other hand/finger to the bird at chest level.', 'Orient your hands so that the easiest way for the parrot to reach the treat is by stepping up onto the offered perch.', 'If your bird does not immediately step up, reward any contact with the offered perch at first, and incrementally reward only the desired step-up behavior.', 'If you’re handy enough with the clicker to use it while both hands are occupied, it can be incorporated, and/or a verbal cue like saying “step up.”', ', If other methods have been less successful, or you have been utilizing target training already, you can teach the step-up by employing the familiar target and reward system.', 'Hold your familiar target — a wooden drumstick, for instance — in one hand, and your desired perch (your finger, hand, or hand-held perch) in the other.', 'Alternatively, if your manual dexterity is up to the task, you can do both with one hand, which leaves the other for holding treats, a clicker, etc.', 'Locate the target so that it directs the bird to the new perch, which should be located in the common step-up position at the bird’s chest.', 'Immediately reward positive behavior, and use the clicker or a verbal cue if desired.', 'Eventually, the target will no longer be required to prompt the behavior.', 'Especially for people new to parrot ownership, talking is usually the first skill they think of teaching and of which they presume their bird will be able to master.', 'The truth of the matter is, every parrot is different, and you should never acquire a bird — even of a breed known for talking — with the assumption that it will talk.', 'Some parrots will require little or no training to learn to talk, and may in fact pick up words and phrases you’d prefer they not repeat.', 'Excited utterances — such as things you might shout at the TV during a sporting event — are often more readily picked up by a parrot, and they’re listening more often than you may think.', 'So be careful what you say around them!', "", Parrots talk to other members of their flock, and it is easier to establish yourself as part of your bird's flock early in its life."", 'Therefore, you are more likely to have success when starting with a baby bird.', 'Use a clear, calm, happy voice to repeat a simple word or phrase as you start the training process.', 'Think about how you would try to teach a human child to say ""Mommy.', '""Early in the process, reward any sound, then any approximately accurate sound, and eventually a recognizable sound with an immediate treat.', 'Repetition is the key element of training a parrot to talk.', 'Simply put, the more times you say a word or phrase around a parrot, the more likely it is to pick it up and repeat it.', 'Train as often as you like.', 'Parrots will not tire of conversing with another member of their flock, although you may.', 'Some experts recommend recording yourself saying a phrase and playing it back on a loop for the bird.', 'Of course, by using this method you lose the personal interaction between the two of you.']"
"Decide what you want your parrot to say, but make it basic. If you want, you can make it say simple but funny things. You should go to a nice and quiet room.

Observe your bird's natural behavior. Choose a command. Create a potty spot. Move your bird to the potty spot when he needs to go. Say your command when your bird defecates. Reward the behavior. Take your bird to the potty spot as often as necessary. Do not train a new bird too early. Keep your expectations realistic. Do not scold or hit your parrot.,How to Toilet Train a Parrot,"In order to potty train your bird, you need to pay attention to how it behaves right before it goes to the bathroom. You should also take note of how often it uses the bathroom. This way, you will know when to and how often to carry your bird to the bathroom area.Most parrots will squat down slightly and flick their tails up when they're ready to go to the bathroom. Watch your bird to see what precise movements it makes when it's getting ready to go.Also, keep track of how often your bird defecates. Parrots can defecate as often as every 15 minutes. This way, you'll know roughly how often you'll need to direct your bird to the bathroom area. , You want a command to reinforce the behavior. You want to be able to say something when you see your bird squatting that will alert it that it needs to go to the bathroom area. Pick something simple, like ""Go potty"" to teach your bird where to use the bathroom.  You should have an area in your parrot's cage where it can go to the bathroom. Most people use something like a waste basket or lay down paper towels or newspaper in a certain portion of their home. You can also use paper plates. Make sure you pick a space the bird can easily access on its own.  Watch your bird when it's out of its cage. Remember the natural behaviors you noticed that indicated the bird needed to use the bathroom. If you see the bird doing things that indicates it needs to go, like squatting or flicking its tail, immediately move the bird to the bathroom area.At first, you will need to use the ""step up"" command to get your bird to climb on your arm or finger. Then, take your bird to the potty spot and hold it over the spot until it goes to the bathroom.  Watch your bird closely. When it defecates, say your command. This will help your bird make the connection. It will realize it's supposed to go to the bathroom in the bathroom area.Some people use commands like ""Hurry up"" if their bird is taking a while to relieve itself. For example, if your bird has been standing on the potty area for a while, you can say something like ""Hurry up!"" and reward your bird as soon as it goes to the bathroom.  Each time the bird goes in the bathroom spot, give it a reward. Parrots respond best to positive reinforcement. Offer a treat and praise when the bird successfully goes to the bathroom in the right spot. Choose a specific treat your parrot only gets for using the bathroom so the parrot understands what it's being rewarded for.You can also reward your bird by letting it out of the cage for a few minutes each time it goes to the bathroom in the proper spot. Then, put it back in its cage until it goes to the bathroom in the right spot again.  Watch your bird closely both inside and outside of its cage. As soon as your bird begins squatting, take it to the potty spot. Do this for a few weeks until your bird knows where to relieve itself. Always say the command and reward your bird for going in the right spot.Be patient. It can be time consuming to be moving the bird to the bathroom area every 10 to 15 minutes, but most birds will eventually learn the behavior.  If you just got a parrot, it will need time to adjust to your home. Potty training, or any kind of training, can be overwhelming if done too early. Spend some time letting your bird adjust. Once your bird is calm and friendly with you, you can begin training.How long your bird needs to relax depends on the temperament of the bird. Some birds come around right away while others need a lot of time.  You cannot expect a bird to learn right away. It will take time and consistency for your parrot to be toilet trained. Even then, you can expect some occasional accidents. Keep these expectations in mind so you do not get angry or frustrated while training your parrot.  Scolding or striking your parrot will not result in it learning faster. In fact, this will only stress out your bird. High levels of stress can cause behavioral problems. Even if your bird is not behaving how you want, you should never hit or scold it.","['In order to potty train your bird, you need to pay attention to how it behaves right before it goes to the bathroom.', 'You should also take note of how often it uses the bathroom.', 'This way, you will know when to and how often to carry your bird to the bathroom area.', ""Most parrots will squat down slightly and flick their tails up when they're ready to go to the bathroom."", ""Watch your bird to see what precise movements it makes when it's getting ready to go."", 'Also, keep track of how often your bird defecates.', 'Parrots can defecate as often as every 15 minutes.', ""This way, you'll know roughly how often you'll need to direct your bird to the bathroom area."", ', You want a command to reinforce the behavior.', 'You want to be able to say something when you see your bird squatting that will alert it that it needs to go to the bathroom area.', 'Pick something simple, like ""Go potty"" to teach your bird where to use the bathroom.', ""You should have an area in your parrot's cage where it can go to the bathroom."", 'Most people use something like a waste basket or lay down paper towels or newspaper in a certain portion of their home.', 'You can also use paper plates.', 'Make sure you pick a space the bird can easily access on its own.', ""Watch your bird when it's out of its cage."", 'Remember the natural behaviors you noticed that indicated the bird needed to use the bathroom.', 'If you see the bird doing things that indicates it needs to go, like squatting or flicking its tail, immediately move the bird to the bathroom area.', 'At first, you will need to use the ""step up"" command to get your bird to climb on your arm or finger.', 'Then, take your bird to the potty spot and hold it over the spot until it goes to the bathroom.', 'Watch your bird closely.', 'When it defecates, say your command.', 'This will help your bird make the connection.', ""It will realize it's supposed to go to the bathroom in the bathroom area."", 'Some people use commands like ""Hurry up"" if their bird is taking a while to relieve itself.', 'For example, if your bird has been standing on the potty area for a while, you can say something like ""Hurry up!"" and reward your bird as soon as it goes to the bathroom.', 'Each time the bird goes in the bathroom spot, give it a reward.', 'Parrots respond best to positive reinforcement.', 'Offer a treat and praise when the bird successfully goes to the bathroom in the right spot.', ""Choose a specific treat your parrot only gets for using the bathroom so the parrot understands what it's being rewarded for."", 'You can also reward your bird by letting it out of the cage for a few minutes each time it goes to the bathroom in the proper spot.', 'Then, put it back in its cage until it goes to the bathroom in the right spot again.', 'Watch your bird closely both inside and outside of its cage.', 'As soon as your bird begins squatting, take it to the potty spot.', 'Do this for a few weeks until your bird knows where to relieve itself.', 'Always say the command and reward your bird for going in the right spot.', 'Be patient.', 'It can be time consuming to be moving the bird to the bathroom area every 10 to 15 minutes, but most birds will eventually learn the behavior.', 'If you just got a parrot, it will need time to adjust to your home.', 'Potty training, or any kind of training, can be overwhelming if done too early.', 'Spend some time letting your bird adjust.', 'Once your bird is calm and friendly with you, you can begin training.', 'How long your bird needs to relax depends on the temperament of the bird.', 'Some birds come around right away while others need a lot of time.', 'You cannot expect a bird to learn right away.', 'It will take time and consistency for your parrot to be toilet trained.', 'Even then, you can expect some occasional accidents.', 'Keep these expectations in mind so you do not get angry or frustrated while training your parrot.', 'Scolding or striking your parrot will not result in it learning faster.', 'In fact, this will only stress out your bird.', 'High levels of stress can cause behavioral problems.', 'Even if your bird is not behaving how you want, you should never hit or scold it.']"
"Choose a white button-down shirt. Gather other supplies. Remove the buttons from the shirt. Sew the button holes closed. Cut velcro to line the shirt opening. Attach the velcro to the shirt opening.

Purchase a light-colored, long-sleeved coverall. Attach elastic to the neck hole and wrists. Put on your suit.",How to Make a Beekeeping Suit,"When it comes to making a beekeeping suit, the shirt is the trickiest part. It's helpful to have a shirt that opens in the front so you can fasten it securely around your veil, but you will need to alter it so bees can't crawl into the holes between the buttons. Look for a shirt with the following qualities:The fabric is thick; look for a heavy cotton or denim.The color is white or another very light color. Bees feel threatened by darker colors, which remind them of bears.The fit is loose. Choose a size or two larger than what you normally wear, rather than getting a shirt that's skin tight. That way if a bee inserts its stinger into the fabric, it won't be right against your skin. , You'll need to make a few alterations along the collar, sleeves and opening in order to create a tight seal that will keep bees from crawling in. It helps to have a sewing machine, but if you don't have one, you can certainly make the alterations by hand. Here's what you need:A roll of one-inch wide white velcro. Stick-on velcro works fine, or you can get the type that doesn't have adhesive backing. You need enough to line the shirt opening, the collar and the sleeve openings, so you may want to take measurements before purchasing velcro.A needle and white thread (or a sewing machine, if you have one).A measuring tape and scissors.  Use a small pair of scissors to snip off all the buttons. Take care to snip the threads just underneath the buttons without cutting a hole in the shirt. Snip the buttons from the opening of the shirt, the collar and the sleeve openings.  Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread. Insert the needle from inside the shirt near the edge of a buttonhole. Stitch the buttonhole tightly closed, then finish it off by tying another tight knot. Repeat until you've sewn every buttonhole closed, including those around the collar and sleeve openings.You might want to double-thread the needle if you're working with thin or weak thread.Neat, invisible stitching is not the goal: just make sure the buttonholes are tightly closed and won't pop open when you're handling bees.  Measure the length of the shirt opening. Place the measuring tape along the edge of the shirt's opening. Measure the length of the opening from the tip of the shirttail to the bottom of the collar. Write down the measurement, then use it to cut two pieces of velcro that will stretch the entire length of the shirt opening on both sides.  Remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces. Sew a piece of velcro over the length of the opening where you cut off the buttons. Sew another piece of velcro along the underside of the opening where you sewed up the buttonholes. The two pieces of velcro should seal firmly together when you close the shirt.If you have a sewing machine, you can quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place. Stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down. You can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle.If you're sewing by hand, make tight, neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while you're wearing your bee suit.  Use the measuring tape to measure around the collar. Cut a length of velcro according to your measurement, and sew it around the inside of the collar. Cut a second length and sew it around the outside of the collar. This will allow you to adjust the collar to make it tight enough to keep bees out. Use the same method to add velcro to the sleeve openings.Again, a sewing machine makes it easy to quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place. Stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down. You can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle.If you're sewing by hand, make tight, neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while you're wearing your bee suit.  A cowboy-style hat with a wide brim makes the perfect base for your beekeeping hat. It will keep the veil from touching your face as you work, making it easier to see and less likely that a bee will get close enough to your skin to sting. Look for a hat with these qualities:The fabric is thick enough to keep out bees, but thin enough to pierce with a sewing needle. Felt and tightly-woven straw hats work well; leather can be too thick.The hat is lightweight enough that you won't overheat. You'll be doing most of your beekeeping in the summer, so keep that in mind when you choose your hate.The brim is stiff, not floppy. It should be firm enough to keep the veil several inches from your face.  You can use stiff nylon mesh, tulle, or wire mesh to make the veil. You need enough veil fabric to fit around the brim of the hat and fall at least five inches below your shoulders. One yard should be sufficient.Be sure to use a clear or white fabric so that you'll be able to see through it easily.If you find a thin tulle you want to use, you may need a double layer to make sure your veil keeps the bees away.  Measure around the brim of the hat, then cut your fabric about an inch wider. You'll need a bit of overlap to make sure the bees can't get through the seam. Make sure the fabric is long enough to drape down five inches below your shoulders.  Overlap the edges by half an inch. Stitch the edges closed to create a large tube of fabric with the same circumference as your hat's brim. Make sure the tube is sturdy enough to keep out bees before moving to the next step. It doesn't hurt to add an extra row of stitches along the seam.  Working by hand, carefully sew the top edge of the veil around the brim of the hat. If you are hand-sewing, be sure to use small whip-stitches to keep all openings too small for the bees to enter and get underneath the mesh. Continue until the veil is tightly secured to the hat.  Your bee-tight shirt and hat are the most important parts, but in order for your suit to work, you'll need a few more items. Remember that everything should be white or light in color:Thick white sweatpants or work pants. Make sure they have tight elastic around the waist and ankles. You can also wear white workout pants if sweatpants are too hot.Tall socks.Thick gloves. Dishwashing gloves work just fine. Some beekeepers prefer to be bare-handed.Sturdy work boots. Look for boots that are ankle or calf length and made of leather or other durable material. There should be enough room around the opening of the boot so you can tuck the bottom of the pants into them.  Set the hat on your head and drape the veil down over your shoulders, bunching it around your neck. Pull up the gloves so that they cover your hands and wrists.  Put it on so that the end of the veil is tucked under the shirt. Secure the shirt opening by pressing the velcro closed. Secure the velcro around the collar and sleeve openings. Check to make sure there are no gaps.  Make sure the elastic on your pants is tight around the bottom of your shirt.  Pull the elastic at the bottom of your pants over your socks. Put on your shoes, and tuck the bottom of your pants into your shoes before tying them. You are now ready to handle bees.  This option is more expensive than making a suit out of a shirt and pants, but some find it easier to have a one-piece suit. make sure the coverall you purchase is white or light in color.Dark colors can aggravate bees since these colors remind them of their predators, like bears and skunks.Make sure the coverall fits loosely in order to keep the material from directly contacting the skin. This helps to avoid stingers that might pierce the fabric.  Measure elastic to fit the neck hole and wrists, then cut the elastic to the correct measurements. Sew the elastic pieces around neck opening and wrist openings.This is important to prevent bees from gaining access to the inside of the coverall.Don't make the elastic too tight, but it should be tight enough to offer protection from bees.  When putting on the beekeeper's suit, put the hat on first, then the coveralls. Make sure the mesh of the hat is securely tucked in at the neck of the coveralls.

"Look for a bee larger than the others in the hive. Look for a bee with a pointed abdomen. Using a magnifying glass, look for a bee without a barb on its stinger. Look for a bee that stands with its legs splayed apart. Watch the way the other bees act subserviently around her.",How to Identify a Queen Bee,"The easiest way to tell the queen bee apart from other bees is by her size. Queens mated with drones are the largest bees in the hive, both longer and wider than other bees, while queens who have yet to mate, or virgin queens, are smaller than mated queens but larger than either worker bees or drones.The queen bee's larger size, as well as her ability to lay eggs, is due to eating protein-rich royal jelly, which is secreted from glands on the heads of young worker bees and mixed with pollen to form a whitish milk or mush. All bees are fed royal jelly for the first few days after hatching, but only queen bees are fed royal jelly until reaching physical maturity. Royal jelly not only enables queen bees to mature sexually, it also enables them to reach physical maturity sooner (after 16 days as opposed to 21 days for worker bees) and contributes to their extended lifespan.Virgin queens are reared in the event the mated queen becomes old or incapacitated. They are kept separate from the mated queen and each other; if 1 virgin queen encounters another, she will attack and attempt to kill it. , A queen bee's larger abdomen is noticeably more pointed than the abdomens of either worker or drone bees.  Worker bees' stingers are barbed; once they sting a target, the barb catches and pulls the stinger from their abdomen, killing the worker. Queen bees, however, have no barbs on their stingers, enabling them to sting a target repeatedly.  Necessary because of her greater size, keeping her legs splayed apart, like those of the bug in the game of Cootie, enables the queen bee to move quickly through the hive.  As long as the queen bee is healthy and productive, worker bees are notably deferential to her, getting out of her way when she moves forward and standing at attention facing her when she stops.","['The easiest way to tell the queen bee apart from other bees is by her size.', 'Queens mated with drones are the largest bees in the hive, both longer and wider than other bees, while queens who have yet to mate, or virgin queens, are smaller than mated queens but larger than either worker bees or drones.', ""The queen bee's larger size, as well as her ability to lay eggs, is due to eating protein-rich royal jelly, which is secreted from glands on the heads of young worker bees and mixed with pollen to form a whitish milk or mush."", 'All bees are fed royal jelly for the first few days after hatching, but only queen bees are fed royal jelly until reaching physical maturity.', 'Royal jelly not only enables queen bees to mature sexually, it also enables them to reach physical maturity sooner (after 16 days as opposed to 21 days for worker bees) and contributes to their extended lifespan.', 'Virgin queens are reared in the event the mated queen becomes old or incapacitated.', 'They are kept separate from the mated queen and each other; if 1 virgin queen encounters another, she will attack and attempt to kill it.', "", A queen bee's larger abdomen is noticeably more pointed than the abdomens of either worker or drone bees."", ""Worker bees' stingers are barbed; once they sting a target, the barb catches and pulls the stinger from their abdomen, killing the worker."", 'Queen bees, however, have no barbs on their stingers, enabling them to sting a target repeatedly.', 'Necessary because of her greater size, keeping her legs splayed apart, like those of the bug in the game of Cootie, enables the queen bee to move quickly through the hive.', 'As long as the queen bee is healthy and productive, worker bees are notably deferential to her, getting out of her way when she moves forward and standing at attention facing her when she stops.']"

"Lift the horse's foot. Remove any shoes that are already on the horse's feet. Clean the bottom of the hoof. Use a hoof knife to remove excess, flaky sole from the bottom of the hoof. Trim excess hoof wall with hoof nippers. Use a rasp to flatten and level the the sole. Size the shoe to its hoof. Make minor adjustments to the shape of the shoe, if needed. Secure the shoe in its place with nails. Bend and remove the nail tips. Clinch the nail. File any rough spots on the hoof wall. Repeat process three more times until all four hooves have been shod.",How to Shoe a Horse,"When working with a horse’s hooves it's important to move the horse's foot into position in a way that doesn't surprise the horse or irritate it. Make sure the horse is aware of your presence by gently patting it on the rump. To get your horse to lift her foot, run your hand down her leg. Then, squeeze the tendon above the ankle and lift the hoof. The horse should shift its weight to its other three feet.While you work, hold the foot in place by tucking your hip against the horse's hock (the large joint on the hind leg) and gaskin (the muscle above the hock). Use the inside of your knee to pull the foot out slightly and up between your legs so that the sole of the hoof faces up towards you. Support the horse's toe with one hand. This position locks the horse's foot in place, making it difficult for the horse to kick or put its foot on the ground before you're done working.Make sure that you reward your horse with praise for cooperating and waiting while you clean her hooves. Saying, “good girl” or “yes” after she lifts each hoof for you will help to reinforce your horse’s good behavior. , To remove a horseshoe, first, ""break"" (straighten) the nail clinches (the bent tips of each nail that holds the shoe on) with a clinch cutter and a hammer. Work the blade of the clinch cutter under the clinch, then hit it with a hammer to straighten the nail. Then, use a pair of metal pull-offs to loosen and remove the shoe. Close the jaws of the pull-offs around the outside heel of the shoe and use an outside to center rocking motion, working towards the toe to loosen the shoe. Repeat for the inside heel and proceed in this fashion until the shoe can be pulled off.Several alternatives exist for breaking the nail clinches. In a pinch, you can use a rock and a flat head screwdriver to bend the nail tips upwards, or, if you're careful not to wear a hole in the hoof wall, you can even use a rasp to file the nail clinches away.  For your horse's health and safety, you don't want dirt or debris trapped between its new shoe and its foot. Before shoeing your horse, use a hoof pick to remove any compacted dirt, mud, rocks, manure, etc. from your horse’s foot. Use downward strokes from heel to toe. Follow the hoof pick with a wire brush for added cleanliness.Take care around the frog - the triangular portion in the middle of the hoof. This part of the hoof is extra-sensitive.  Typically, before a horse is shod, the dark, hard, outer layer of each hoof's sole is removed to reveal the softer, whiter material underneath in a process roughly equivalent to trimming a human's toenails. Take care not to cut too deep, or you risk hurting the horse or even rendering it temporarily lame - the same as if you'd cut a person's nails too short.This process is easiest if you keep your hoof knife razor sharp. But use caution. It's easy to accidentally slip and cut yourself while working.  The hoof wall - the edge of the hoof - should extend about 3 inches (7.6 cm) to 3 & 3/4 inches from the hairline above the hoof itself. If it's any longer, use a set of nippers (essentially giant nail clippers) to trim the edge of the hoof to a suitable length.You should see a ridge where the hoof wall extends beyond the sole. Do not cut into the sole with the nippers, or you may injure the horse.When you trim the hoof with nippers, be sure to keep the trimmed edges of the hoof uniformly straight and level so that they'll sit flush with the ground. Trim from each side of the heel to the toe.The exception to this is in cases where a horse's gait wears its hoof unevenly - in this case, you'll want to take slightly less hoof material off of the side that the horse favors. Use caution when making this distinction and, if unsure, consult an experienced farrier.  The very last thing that must be done to prepare the hoof for its shoe is to ensure the bottom of the hoof is smooth, flat and level. Use a rasp to gently file any uneven spots on the bottom of the hoof, taking care, as always, not to wear the hoof too short or irritate the frog. Then using your knife, pare away slightly to bevel the sole away from the hoof wall. Contact of the sole on the shoe can cause the horse discomfort.  As with human feet, horse feet come in many different sizes and, thus, different horses will require different-sized shoes. Before proceeding, ensure that the shoes you have available are the correct size for your horse's feet. Note that a horse's front and hind feet are differently-shaped, so you will need different shoes for each.most horses have a size smaller in the back then the front, but not always.If you have to choose between shoes that are slightly too big and shoes that are slightly too small, choose the bigger shoes. These can be bent, shaped, and ground down to a smaller size, while too-small shoes can't be made bigger. Too long a shoe in front will cause the horse to step on the exposed heel of the shoe and pull it off.  Often, even if horse shoes are the correct size, they will not fit a horse's foot without adjustments. Like human feet, horse feet can be asymmetrical or uneven. There are several ways to custom-shape horseshoes.If you're a knowledgeable metalworker, you can heat the shoe until the steel can be bent to the size of the hoof.Or, you can cold shape the shoe on an anvil using a hammer and tongs.Some farriers do neither, opting instead to grind their shoes down until they fit with a rasp or grinding machine.Well-fitting horse shoes should align well with the edge of the hoof. Keep in mind that it may take some time to get a shoe to the perfect size for your horse.  Align the shoe so that it sits perfectly against the edge of the hoof, then drive nails through the holes in the shoe to fix it to the horse's foot. When doing this, care must be taken so as not to hurt or hobble the horse.Drive the nail through the hoof at an outward angle so that the nail tips go through the top of the hoof wall.Never drive nails into the sensitive inner portion of the hoof. To make this easier, use hoof nails that have a bevel on one side to guide the tip through the hoof wall.With these special nails, the manufacturer's stamp on the side of the nail head should face the center of the foot (towards the frog) - this ensures that the bevel is facing the right direction.Some modern horseshoes use glue, rather than nails, to hold the shoe in place.If you're worried about hurting your horse, you may want to try this alternative. Note that application methods for glue-on shoes can vary - consult the manufacturer or an experienced farrier for more information.  Once each nail has been driven, use the claw end of your hammer to bend the tip of the nail over against the hoof wall. Then, twist off the tip or use a pair of nippers to bend and clip the tips off. Try leave about 1/8"" of the tip bent over the edge of the hole formed by the nail pointing towards the toe. This ensures that the nail will hold the shoe in place without the sharp tip hurting you or the horse.  Set a clinch block under the nail on the outer hoof wall, then set the nail in the hoof (or ""clinch"" it) by hitting the nail head once again with the driving hammer. This gives the nail a firm grip in the horse's hoof, ensuring the shoe stays in place. You may use a sturdy metal tool, like your nippers, in place of the clinch block in a pinch.Another option is to use a special tool called a clincher. With this tool, all you need to do is align the jaws of the clincher over the nail tip and squeeze the handles.  Finally, give the outside of the hoof a once-over with a rasp, smoothing out any uneven spots and giving the hoof a nice clean finish. Pay special attention to the clinched nail tips, which can also be filed smooth.When finished, you should be able to draw a cloth over the hoof wall without it catching.You may also notice that excess hoof material protrudes over the edge of the shoe. If this is the case, use a pair of nippers or pull-offs to remove it.  Remember that the front and back hooves will require differently-shaped shoes and that even the two front and back feet may not be perfectly symmetrical with each other.","[""When working with a horse’s hooves it's important to move the horse's foot into position in a way that doesn't surprise the horse or irritate it."", 'Make sure the horse is aware of your presence by gently patting it on the rump.', 'To get your horse to lift her foot, run your hand down her leg.', 'Then, squeeze the tendon above the ankle and lift the hoof.', 'The horse should shift its weight to its other three feet.', ""While you work, hold the foot in place by tucking your hip against the horse's hock (the large joint on the hind leg) and gaskin (the muscle above the hock)."", 'Use the inside of your knee to pull the foot out slightly and up between your legs so that the sole of the hoof faces up towards you.', ""Support the horse's toe with one hand."", ""This position locks the horse's foot in place, making it difficult for the horse to kick or put its foot on the ground before you're done working."", 'Make sure that you reward your horse with praise for cooperating and waiting while you clean her hooves.', 'Saying, “good girl” or “yes” after she lifts each hoof for you will help to reinforce your horse’s good behavior.', ', To remove a horseshoe, first, ""break"" (straighten) the nail clinches (the bent tips of each nail that holds the shoe on) with a clinch cutter and a hammer.', 'Work the blade of the clinch cutter under the clinch, then hit it with a hammer to straighten the nail.', 'Then, use a pair of metal pull-offs to loosen and remove the shoe.', 'Close the jaws of the pull-offs around the outside heel of the shoe and use an outside to center rocking motion, working towards the toe to loosen the shoe.', 'Repeat for the inside heel and proceed in this fashion until the shoe can be pulled off.', 'Several alternatives exist for breaking the nail clinches.', ""In a pinch, you can use a rock and a flat head screwdriver to bend the nail tips upwards, or, if you're careful not to wear a hole in the hoof wall, you can even use a rasp to file the nail clinches away."", ""For your horse's health and safety, you don't want dirt or debris trapped between its new shoe and its foot."", 'Before shoeing your horse, use a hoof pick to remove any compacted dirt, mud, rocks, manure, etc. from your horse’s foot.', 'Use downward strokes from heel to toe.', 'Follow the hoof pick with a wire brush for added cleanliness.', 'Take care around the frog -

Consider whether you should harvest the sugarbag honey. Separate the honey 'super' from the 2 brood boxes. Pierce the sugarbag pots. Drain the sugarbag honey. Filter the sugarbag honey. Place the honey super back onto the top of the hive.,How to Harvest Sugarbag Honey From a Native Australian Beehive,"You should only harvest the honey if the bees will survive without it. Generally, only harvest the sugarbag honey this way if:You have had the hive for 12-18 months, long enough for them to collect ample resourcesYou live in an area that does not go/rarely goes below 18 degrees Celsius, even in winter. This is because the bees will not be able to fly and collect resources, and so they need the stored food. It is probably not a good idea to harvest the honey if you live in Sydney.Your hive is a 3-part OATH hive;, Using a hive tool, split the top box from the bottom two.  Invert the honey super. Press a bed of nails tool through the propolis pots, until the sugarbag honey sits on top of the squashed pots.  Place the honey super face down on a container to allow all of the sugarbag honey to drip out of the super. Leave it for around 10 minutes.  Take the drained honey in the container and pour it through a sieve to filter out any dead bees and other impurities. Seal the container you filtered the sugarbag honey into.  Seal it using duct tape or plastic strapping. The bees will reuse the propolis that was left in the honey super, converting it back into more honey pots!","['You should only harvest the honey if the bees will survive without it.', 'Generally, only harvest the sugarbag honey this way if:You have had the hive for 12-18 months, long enough for them to collect ample resourcesYou live in an area that does not go/rarely goes below 18 degrees Celsius, even in winter.', 'This is because the bees will not be able to fly and collect resources, and so they need the stored food.', 'It is probably not a good idea to harvest the honey if you live in Sydney.', 'Your hive is a 3-part OATH hive;, Using a hive tool, split the top box from the bottom two.', 'Invert the honey super.', 'Press a bed of nails tool through the propolis pots, until the sugarbag honey sits on top of the squashed pots.', 'Place the honey', 'super face down on a container to allow all of the sugarbag honey to drip out of the super.', 'Leave it for around 10 minutes.', 'Take the drained honey in the container and pour it through a sieve to filter out any dead bees and other impurities.', 'Seal the container you filtered the sugarbag honey into.', 'Seal it using duct tape or plastic strapping.', 'The bees will reuse the propolis that was left in the honey super, converting it back into more honey pots!']"
"Get a small-ish guinea pig cage that will fit in the backseat of your car. Fill it with a thick layer of newspaper or a waterproof sheet and cover with a soft fleece or towel bedding. Place an attachable ceramic bowl in the cage and fill it with your guinea pig's favorite food before hooking it to the cage. Hook up a water bottle and fill it up to the brim. Put a few handfuls of hay into the cage. Give your guinea pig a toy or two as long as they are light and small - you don't want them to slide and hit your guinea pigs. Put some veggies your guinea pigs like into the cage. Put your guinea pigs in to the cage and put the cage in the car on a seat with the seat belt done up. Talk to your guinea pigs whenever you get the chance. Try to pull pull over at a rest stop every hour. When you have reached your destination, move your guinea pig into a proper hutch or cage, away from direct sunlight.",How to Transport a Guinea Pig,"If possible, use your guinea pig's current cage to reduce stress. If that is not possible, buy a small-animal carrying/travel cage - it should be made of plastic or cloth, not metal, and none of it should be made of mesh. Make sure that you fasten the seat-belt around the cage so that it doesn't jolt around.Two guinea pigs can be placed into one cage, but if you are taking more guinea pigs then you will need more cages for safety reasons. ,, Never use a loose bowl as it could slide and harm your guinea pig.  Make sure that it is attached to the cage securely so that it does not fall as this could injure your guinea pigs.Make sure that the cage is level to stop the water from leaking - if your guinea pigs become wet then they could become cold.Fairly large water bottles are good for longer journeys as, particularly if your car is quite warm, your guinea pig will drink a lot. ,,, If there is no room on the seats then place the guinea pigs in a footwell.

Schedule an appointment with an allergist. Take antihistamines. Consider taking decongestants. Use corticosteroid nasal sprays. Use high-efficiency air filters and purifiers. Confine your guinea pig in one part of your home. Protect yourself from the most common sources of allergens. Wear protective equipment when handling your guinea pig. Wash your hands after any allergen contact. Ask someone who's not allergic to handle guinea pig duties. Consider finding a new home for your pet. Rule out hay/straw allergies. Check if wood shavings are the problem. Try out other guinea pig foods.,How to Reduce Guinea Pig Allergy,"If you suspect you may have an allergy to guinea pigs (or any other potential allergen), the first thing you should do is visit an allergist. An allergist can help you determine whether or not your guinea pig is the problem and advise you on how to limit/avoid exposure and treat your symptoms.Allergists treat both allergies and asthma (especially asthma induced by an allergic reaction).Your allergist will most likely conduct a round of tests, which may include skin exposure tests, to confirm that guinea pigs are the source of your allergies.See an allergist right away if you experience prolonged allergy symptoms, coughing/wheezing, shortness of breath, or any other quality of life issues associated with a suspected allergy.In rare cases, extreme allergies may cause anaphylaxis, a potentially fatal reaction. If you experience vomiting, diarrhea, a sudden drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, a swollen tongue or throat, loss of consciousness, or severe hives or skin redness, go to an emergency room immediately. , Antihistamines are one of the most commonly-taken allergy medications. They are available over the counter or by prescription, and they come in tablet, syrup, or nasal spray forms.Antihistamines reduce your body's immune system response to allergens.An antihistamine can help reduce itchy skin, sneezing, and runny nose.Common over-the-counter tablets include fexofenadine (Allegra), loratadine (Claritin, Alavert) and cetirizine (Zyrtec).Common prescription tablets include levocetirizine (Xyzal) and desloratadine (Clarinex).Frequently-prescribed nasal sprays include azelastine (Astelin and Astepro) and olopatadine (Patanase).  Decongestants reduce nasal swelling/inflammation, which can make it easier to breathe if you're experiencing sneezing or stuffy nose. They are often sold as nasal sprays, and can typically be acquired without a prescription.Some over-the-counter allergy medications pair antihistamines and decongestants together in one oral tablet.Decongestants aren't for everyone. They can have serious negative side effects for some individuals, including elevated blood pressure.If you currently have high blood pressure, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, or an enlarged prostate, do not take decongestants unless your doctor has told you it is safe to do so.  Corticosteroid nasal sprays are inserted into the nostril, sprayed, and inhaled. This class of medicine is typically administered in low doses and tend to have far fewer side effects than oral corticosteroids.Common nasal sprays that are available without a prescription include fluticasone (Flonase), mometasone furoate (Nasonex), and triamcinolone (Nasacort AQ).If over-the-counter nasal sprays aren't enough, ask your doctor whether prescription-strength corticosteroids might help your symptoms.  If you're experiencing an allergic reaction to guinea pigs in your home, you may find it helpful to use an air filter or purifier.These products help remove allergens from the air, reducing respiratory problems and potentially reducing contact of airborne particles with your skin.If you purchase an air filter/purifier, make sure you use a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and air purifiers.HEPA filters and purifiers have been shown to reduce airborne allergens in some environments.  If you or a family member are experiencing guinea pig allergies, make sure your guinea pig is not permitted to roam freely around the house. This can help limit or even eliminate exposure to the allergens, which may make it easier to live with a guinea pig in the home for some individuals.Keep your guinea pig's cage in a designated area that can be avoided. Do not put it in common areas like the living room or kitchen, or in/near your bedroom.The room where you keep your guinea pig should ideally be uncarpeted for ease of cleaning. Wood, tile, linoleum, or vinyl flooring materials are much easier to clean and will not harbor allergens like a carpet would.  If you're allergic to guinea pigs, it's important to remember that the protein responsible for that allergy is mostly found in the animal's saliva and urine. However, that protein can be transferred to the guinea pig's coat or skin during grooming or passing waste, and may be transferred to your skin if you handle the guinea pig or its bedding. Therefore, the urine, saliva, hair, and skin dander should all be considered potential sources of allergen exposure.Exposure to these allergens can cause symptoms immediately, or after numerous days, weeks, months, or even years of exposure.If you are unable to avoid being around a guinea pig for whatever reason, make sure you avoid contact with these sources of allergens. If contact cannot be avoided, make sure you take protective measures.  Protective equipment may allow you to handle guinea pigs and their bedding or simply be around guinea pigs without experiencing allergic reactions. Protective equipment may not be enough, though, and you may need to take some type of allergy medication for extra safety.Wearing a dust mask can help prevent bronchial irritation and asthma-like symptoms, if you've experienced those symptoms in the past.Gloves and long-sleeved shirts can help reduce your skin contact with guinea pigs, especially while handling the animals themselves or cleaning their cages.Do not wear the long-sleeved shirt you wore while handling your guinea pig for other purposes unless it's been washed since the last time you came into contact with the guinea pig or its bedding.  Any time you've handled a guinea pig, cleaned its enclosure, or handled any materials from inside that enclosure, make sure you wash your hands as soon as possible.It's important to follow proper hand-washing techniques to ensure that your skin is clean and free of allergens to reduce or prevent a reaction.Get your hands wet under the faucet with clean, running water. The temperature doesn't really matter, since the point is to wash away allergens and not germs.Apply enough soap to adequately cover both hands with the lather.Work the soap between your hands, between your fingers, on the backs of your hands, and under your fingernails. Apply soap to any other part of your body that may have come in contact with allergens (wrists and arms, for example).Scrub the soap on your skin for at least 20 seconds. A common way to keep time is by singing or humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song twice in a row while you scrub your skin.If you've been bitten or scratched by a guinea pig, wash the site of your injury with soap and water for 15 minutes or longer to ensure that you remove the allergens from the wound.Rub your hands under the tap to wash away any traces of soap, which should also remove the allergens your skin came into contact with.Use a clean, dry paper towel to wipe your hands dry. Discard the paper towel when you are finished.  Depending on your situation, you may be able to find someone else willing to take on guinea pig duties for you. Ask others you live or work with if they would be willing to take over these responsibilities.If you work at a pet store, let your supervisors know that you've experienced allergic reactions to guinea pigs and request that you be excused from handling, feeding, or cleaning them.If your guinea pig is a pet at home, ask a family member or roommate to take over guinea pig duties. If you can't find anyone willing to do this, you may have to consider giving your guinea pig to a home where allergies won't be a problem.  Though it's always difficult to part with a pet, you may not have a choice if your allergies are severe. Talk to pet stores and adoption agencies in your region to see if they can help you find a new home for your guinea pig. You should also make sure that any home your pet ends up in is safe by talking to the prospective buyer/adopter and asking about his or her previous pet ownership and animal care experience.  If you're experiencing allergies around a guinea pig, there is a slight chance that it may not be the guinea pig itself causing your reactions. An allergist can help you identify whether you're allergic to some environmental factor, like hay/straw used for the animal's bedding.Hay and straw often cause asthma-like reactions, including difficulty breathing, increased production of mucus, and congestion in the chest.Many people experience dermatitis symptoms as an allergic reaction to skin contact with hay/straw.Dermatitis is usually characterized by red, itchy, or inflamed skin. It may look like a rash on the skin, usually at the point of exposure.  Some people experience allergic reactions to wood shavings that are commonly used as guinea pig bedding. Talk to an allergist, or try out a different bedding material that's free from any potential allergens.Even if wood shavings themselves aren't the problem, many people experience allergies to the various coloring, fragrances, and oils added to guinea pig bedding.Eucalyptus oil and Manuka oil are common additives to guinea pig bedding.Make sure your wood shavings do not have any of these additives, or try a different bedding material altogether.  If bedding isn't the issue, there is a slight chance you may be allergic to the food you're feeding your guinea pig. Handling food or treats that contain an artificial color or other additives could be what's causing your reaction, though only an allergist can confirm this for sure.Artificial coloring agents that begin with the letter E, such as E110, are commonly added to dried food and treats.These coloring agents have produced allergic reactions in some individuals, though again, it's more likely that you're allergic to the animal itself or its bedding.Talk to an allergist to determine the source of your allergies and find ways to treat or avoid those allergens.","['If you suspect you may have an

Set the hay rack in the cage.",How to Set Up a Guinea Pig Cage,"Guinea pigs need a cage that is at least 7.5 square foot and even bigger for three. The bigger the cage the better! Guinea pigs love to run around (often called zoomies) and popcorning. They can't do this in a tiny amount of space. A large cage is essential for exercise too.  Hutches are typically suited for the outdoors. You can purchase a simple one-story hutch with an opening and built-in hut or opt for a two-story hutch with a ramp. Two-story hutches provide more room but they are still limited. Hutches that expand outwards can also be bought.  These cages cannot be kept outdoors and must be positioned indoors. C & C caging has become increasingly popular for it's large sizing, simple DIY, cheap material and easy expansion and access. If you would like an indoor cavy, a C & C cage is the one for you.  Coops are just as good as a normal hutch. Coops can actually be a better alternative to a hutch as they're often bigger to fit a flock of standard chickens. Some have attached runs to enable your guinea pig to have access to the lawn.  These are another satisfactory cage to buy but don't fall into the trap of getting a cage that's too small for your guinea pig or has a wired bottom. Purchase one that is at least 7.5 square feet.Don't buy wired cages that are designed for mice, rats or hamsters. Guinea pigs are completely different to these smaller rodents and cannot withstand the same living conditions.  Runs provide a lot of beneficial space, but they aren't the safest or best of cages to use. They don't have much coverage from predators and cannot protect your guinea pigs from harsh weather conditions.A run is best used for guinea pigs on sunny days to provide exercise and fun time for your cavy under your supervision.  Many pet shops tend to sell their customers cages that are way too small and are just not suitable for a guinea pig to live in. Most don't meet the minimal requirements of 7.5 square feet and are more designed for small rodents such as mice and hamsters rather than cavies.  This is a once popular option (and still is) for those who don't put in the time to research the requirements of a guinea pig. These types of caging don't allow for proper air circulation or provide enough space.  The cage you purchase should have a flat, solid bottom. Guinea pigs have sensitive feet. A wire bottom will promote the growth of bumble foot which will then require medical care.  If you have cats and dogs or other wild predators in the area it's your job to ensure that your guinea pigs cage is safe and secure. Make sure that there are locks to the cages, a roof, solid floor and strong wood/metal.A wired cage or C & C cage will not suffice outdoors. They aren't stable and don't provide protection from predators.  If you live in a very cold or hot climate, you should consider keeping your guinea pigs indoors or at least have a back-up indoor cage for your guinea pig to stay when the colder/hotter months peak. Guinea pigs are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and must eat a lot more to keep warm.Ideally, the guinea pigs should be kept in a room that is approximately 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit.Guinea pigs don't do well in humid locations such as sheds and garages on hot days. Humidity encourages bacteria to grow and can cause a fungal infection.Guinea pigs have sensitive hearing so shouldn't be placed in an area that is prone to loud noises such as right beside televisions or loud stereos.If you have young children, place your guinea pigs cage in a room where you can monitor them and supervise any small children at the same time.As much as it's popular, keeping your guinea pig outdoors isn't suggested as they don't like being confined in solitary. Make your guinea pig feel a part of the family. Keeping them in your bedroom should also be avoided as it's another way for them to be forgotten.  If you're buying a cage that requires a ramp, or already comes with one, make sure the ramp you acquire is suitable for your guinea pig. The ramp mustn't be too steep where your guinea pig is prone too falling and it should have a good grip on it so that your guinea pig can go up and down with no problems.  There are many types of bedding to avoid when it comes to choosing the perfect material for your guinea pig. This includes certain brands and even certain wood.Never use cedar or pine shavings. These type of wood are toxic to guinea pigs and can cause serious respiratory problems. The oils in them get stuck in their lungs. However, pine can be used as long as it's aired out.Never use sawdust. Again, the dust that is inhaled by guinea pigs is a major cause of respiratory disease and sneezing.Never use corncob bedding. Corncob has a tendency to mold and is hard on their feet. Since guinea pigs have sensitive feet you should steer clear of corncob.Never primarily use newspaper. Although newspaper is perfectly fine itself and can be used as lining at the bottom of the cage, it isn't absorbent enough to use as your main bedding.Never use straw. Straw is tough and can easily cause eye injuries. It isn't absorbent enough to be used as bedding and can also be expensive.  Many guinea pig experts suggest to stay away from wood shavings as a lot of risks are involved with the use of this material such as oils that dry the skin, dust that ultimately causes respiratory problems and possible eye irritation.  Fleece is a popular choice to use as bedding as it seems to have little to no problems at all. However, keeping your guinea pig on fleece will require more regular cleaning including spot cleaning daily and an overall clean weekly.  Shredded bedding can be purchased from pet stores or you can shred your own. It's quite absorbent and soft on your cavies feet without any toxins in it. This makes it a safe material to use. However, it will absorb their urine and make the smell linger.  CareFresh helps eliminate odours and is soft on the guinea pigs feet. However, some tend to avoid unnaturally scented or colored bedding to lessen any risks.  Aspen is another popular choice as it contains no toxic oils, unnatural scents or dyes. It's completely natural and safe to use. You can buy this specific kind of bedding at pet stores.  Hay can be quite absorbent, natural, safe and help control odours. However, it's quite pricey if you don't buy it from the right place. Pet stores are notorious for overcharging when it comes to hay. But you can easily purchase hay from equestrian centers or farm stops for approximately $5 a bale.  You can opt for a water bottle or a water bowl which are completely different to each other. You can always buy both if you have more than one guinea pig.Water bottles keep bedding, food and hay out of the water if your guinea pig is living in a smaller area but they're notorious for leaking and soiling the bedding.Water bowls don't leak and are a more natural way for your guinea pig to acquire water. But they can get messy if you use wood shavings as bedding or keep their food/hay nearby.  The guinea pig pellets should be kept inside the bowl for hygienic reasons and to keep them from spoiling. You can purchase two if you would like to keep their vegetables in a bowl also or even more if you have two guinea pigs (or more) that require 1 cup of vegetables each.  Guinea pigs are prey animals; their instinct is to hide when in fear. You need to have at least one or two hide-outs for your guinea pigs as a safe place and a relaxing centre. One of the worst things you can do is stress your guinea pig out, and with the option of seeking refuge in a hut, you can reduce stress levels.  Toys help stimulate the mind and encourage exercise and, of course, promote fun and enjoyment! Toys are a great way to reduce boredom, depression and even loneliness. However, don't overcrowd their cage with toys. Guinea pigs need space to run too!Toy obstacles can promote exercise whilst chew toys can help prevent dentistry problems as guinea pig teeth are forever growing.Consider toys such as igloos, tunnels, bridges, wood blocks, cat toys (with bells on them), cage accessories, hammocks, cosies, etc.Don't buy wood toys that splinter, wire balls or any toys that can be a choking hazard.  Hay racks can help bundle the hay together and keep it in place, making the overall space of the cage cleaner and more hygienic. However, avoid wire hay racks and opt for cotton bags/sacks instead. There are a number of incidences of guinea pigs getting their heads/bodies stuck in between the wires.  Guinea pigs need their cages cleaned at least once a week and sometimes daily if you decide to spot clean (especially if you're using fleece bedding). You will need a brush, cloth, gloves, pet-friendly antibacterial spray, scooper, bin bags, etc.  This is optional and most apply to long-haired breeds such as peruvians and shelties. However, you can choose to have some grooming products set aside for whenever you need it. You could also optionally book an appointment with a professional groomer.Purchase a soft bristled brush. Long haired guinea pigs require daily grooming to prevent knots and matting from forming in their fur.Purchase clippers. Long-haired breeds such as Shelties have constant growing fur that require clipping annually (or perhaps every few months).Buy nail trimmers. Occasionally you might have to purchase nail trimmers to clip your guinea pigs over-grown nails.  Unless you got your hutch home already assembled on a trailer it will require assembling, including store-bought hutches. Hutches are quite easy to assemble providing that you have the instructions and all the parts to it.  Your hutch should be out of direct sunlight and preferably in a weather proof area under the roof of the house. The area should be well ventilated, secured away from predators (and other pets) and not too cold or too hot.  Straw or wood shavings is recommended for hutches. Ones that go directly on grass will only need bedding in the inside area. Consider lining the hutch with newspaper first and then your main bedding. Guinea pig urine can stain bottom of wooden hutches. The newspaper should catch any leaks.Hutches are best without the use of fleece.  Water bottles can connect to the wire bars of the hutch or you can opt towards a water bowl instead. Keep your water bowl a short distance from the pellets to prevent mess.  Guinea pigs benefit with at least two shelters to escape to when in fear, especially in an outdoor hutch where many wild animals can scare your guinea pig.  Avoid overcrowding the hutch and keep most of the toys outside at the bottom level if it's a two-story hutch. Cosies can be kept in the inside area but to a minimum.  Most hay racks can be pitched up between the wires of the hutch, even cotton hay racks. The hay rack would be best positioned on the bottom story of the cage or away from the water bowl.Remember, guinea pigs will make a lot of mess when it comes to hay. They like to hide in it, pull it out and sleep in it.  The ramp shouldn't be too steep but should have a good grip on it so your guinea pigs can move up and down without any struggles or slips. It should optionally have juts to make the grip better.  Firstly connect the grids which should be able to snap together easily with connectors. Then you will have to set the coroplast at the same length as your grids.Make sure the opening of the cube grids aren't too big/wide enough for your guinea pig to fit it's head through. If it's head can fit through then it's body will fit through too.  C & C's are not outdoor cages as they aren't secure or weather proof at all! Keep it in a room where you can supervise any young children but also keep it away from pets and loud noises. However, do not isolate the cage. The guinea pigs should feel a part of the family not placed in solitary confinement.  Your bottom layer should be lined up with newspaper for extra absorbency and to catch any leaks, and then your primary bedding. Fleece is best suited for C & C cages, but it doesn't limit you to the choice of many other types of bedding such as wood shavings or CareFresh.  Water bottles can be hooked onto the grids and your bowls can be positioned beside your water source (unless you're using a bowl). Don't place the pellets directly under the water bottle as bottles have the tendency to leak which will spoil the feed.  In an open cage without a lid, you should have plenty of coverage with the use of huts, bridges, shelters and hide-outs to help your guinea pig feel safe and secure and to give them a place to run to when in fear. At least two should be satisfactory for your guinea pig - the more guinea pigs the more hide-outs!, A spacious C & C cage could benefit with some toys for your guinea pigs entertainment. You could add various tunnels, hammocks and toy balls.  You can hook the hay rack onto the grid or, if you don't have one, place a pile of hay in the centre of the cage. Most hay racks can be purchased online or in pet stores. Avoid wire racks however.  Coops are very similar to hutches but most are a lot bigger than guinea pig hutches. You can assemble them in the same manner. They should come with instructions and all the necessary parts to assemble.  Coop best dwells on grass, which will save you on bedding expenses. There's no need for lining the bottom layer with bedding as long as the coop is resting on grass. Most coops can go in direct sunlight as their construction and frame offers permanent shade for your piggy, but keep it under the shade of a tree on hotter days.  Coops can go on grass so it saves you spending a fortune on bedding. But the nesting box/area still needs to be lined up with bedding. It's suggested to line a bottom layer of newspaper and then shavings/hay.  Like other cages, the bottle can grip onto the grids/wiring. However, keep your pellets away from the edges of the cage as sudden rainy showers can spoil the unprotected food. Keep it under the nesting box/ramp.  The ramp shouldn't be too steep and should have a proper grip via soft sandpaper or juts in the ramp structure. If your guinea pig is slipping or struggling to go up and down the ramp, you might need to make some adjustments as the ramp is designed for chickens rather than rodents.  Guinea pigs still need a place to escape to even in a protected coop. If your guinea pigs live outdoors it's important for your guinea pigs to have a quick place to hide, especially on the lower level.  Tunnels, cosies, toy balls and wood blocks can all make the coop seem a lot homely and friendly to your guinea pigs. Avoid adding too many toys, however.  The hay rack should be able to clip onto the grids of the coop. Opt for cotton hay racks instead of wire hack racks which are proven to be dangerous to your guinea pig. You should place it at the bottom of the cage.  Wired cages are just as easy to assemble as hutches and C & C caging. They're actually very similar to C & C cages and can be set up the same way.  Wired cages aren't suitable to go outdoors and should be kept inside your home. The cage offers no protection from predators or harsh weather conditions thus why it should be kept inside of your house where the guinea pig can get plenty of family interaction.  The type of bedding you use is very similar to C & C cages. Fleece is the most popular options, however you can still use any other bedding choice available. You should line newspaper at the bottom to ensure extra absorbency and so that you can catch leaks.  As usual, the bottles can be hung up by the grids whilst pellets should be placed in the bowl and away from the water source to prevent leaks into the food.  You should provide at least two huts for your guinea pig, however keep it at a minimum as the space is limited.  Space availability in wire cages can be limited, so keep the toys to a minimum. The maximum might be three or four. Remember to add various toys such as tunnels, wood blocks and hammocks for your guinea pigs to play with.  As mentioned in the steps above you can hook the hay rack to the cage, but avoid using wired hay racks with can pose a potential hazard to your guinea pig.","['Guinea pigs need a cage that is at least

"Purchase or build a cage. Line the cage up with absorbent bedding. Choose where to keep the cage. Decide on water bottles or water bowls. Purchase a food bowl. Purchase food prior to the arrival of your guinea pigs. Choose your hay. Purchase a hay dispenser. Purchase huts, tunnels and toys for your guinea pig.",How to Prepare for Your New Guinea Pig,"Guinea pigs can be housed in three different types of cages; C & C, hutches or runs. You can purchase these from warehouse/pet stores or build your own. The cage must be at least 4 square feet for each guinea pig housed in it (the more the better) or at least 8 square feet for two.Don't fall into the trap of buying inappropriate sized cages from pet shops that do not hold enough space for guinea pigs.If you want to keep your guinea pig indoors then a C & C cage is recommended. Hutches are recommended if you're keeping your guinea outside.The cage must have a solid floor. Don't purchase one with a wired floor as guinea pigs have fragile feet. Wire flooring can and will easily cause bumble foot.Most C & C cages do not have lids. If your cage is going outdoors, you have small children or dangerous pets in the house then you will need a lid on your cage.Do not use an aquarium for a cage as the glass sides don't provide good ventilation and most are terribly small. , You will need two layers of bedding to ensure extra absorbency as guinea pigs tend to wee a lot. Your first layer should be either newspaper or puppy pads which will take in any leaks and protect the flooring. The second layer should be either wood shavings or fleece lined on top of the first layer.Fleece is more suitable for indoor cages such as C & C cages but will require more regular cleaning and possibly spot cleaning. And cleaning the fleece is a bit more difficult as you will need to shake off and vacuum the fleece before washing it.Wood shavings require less regular cleaning and is generally easier to clean. It's also less smelly and more absorbent.  You will want to keep the cage in an area where it's safe, secure and away from any toxins or dangerous pets. Guinea pigs like somewhere that doesn't get too stressful or too noisy - somewhere that gets light traffic.Keep the cage out of direct, constant sunlight. Morning sun is adequate for guinea pigs but they prefer to keep out of constant sunlight.Keep the cage away from any dangerous pets and small children. Dogs and cats will easily scare your guinea pigs as would small children who aren't supervised.Do not keep the cage in a garage where toxic fumes are given off from cars. This could be fatal to your guinea pigs.  Water bottles are less messy but some do leak. However bowls don't leak and are more natural to the guinea pig but if you use wood shavings expect to see some mess.Some guinea pigs prefer to drink from bottles whilst other like bowls as a more natural instinct. Ask the previous owner of the guinea pigs to see which one they use.Remember to never add vitamin supplements to your guinea pigs water as it isn't effective and your guinea pig could refuse to drink.  Your guinea pig will need somewhere to eat. Purchase two bowls - one for pellets and one for vegetables. You should avoid chucking their food on the ground as it's unsanitary.  Guinea pigs will need pellets and plenty of vegetables every day. Pellets should be unlimited however whilst they need 1 cup of mixed vegetables a day (each). So make sure to plan ahead!Make sure to purchase plain pellets rather than a guinea pig mix. Guinea pigs will pick out their favourite treats out of a mix which results to them not eating what they actually need.You can also optionally purchase commercial treats if you plan on training your guinea pig. However, treats should be kept to a limit due to the high sugar content.  Guinea pigs need an unlimited supply of hay as they are grazing animals. If they aren't constantly chewing on something their digestive tracts can shut down.Purchase a reliable, good quality manufacture of hay such as oxbow and/or timothy hay. Alfalfa should only be fed to guinea pig pups and nursing or pregnant sows.  An hay dispenser will lessen the mess of hay and make it last longer rather than scattering the hay on the floor. You can purchase a hay dispenser from a pet shop or use a small paper bin instead.  A main criteria that needs to be met for guinea pigs is entertainment and comfort through toys and tunnels.You should have at least two huts/tunnels or one hut/tunnel per guinea pig. Guinea pigs like being hidden and need a place to run to when scared or in conflict.

Have fun communicating with your monkey.",How to Take Care of a Monkey,"Monkeys are in the order of primates, which is divided into families of New World primates (smaller, tree-dwelling monkeys from South America) and families of Old World primates (larger, ground and tree-dwelling monkeys from Asia and Africa). Each type of monkey has unique characteristics that affect how they fare as pets. Before you decide which type to get, conduct a lot of research on its characteristics. Read books, talk to owners, and get to know as many monkeys as you can in person.Squirrel monkeys, capuchins, spiders, and macaques are all types of monkeys people keep as pets. Some are more social, while others can be on the nervous side. These monkeys all have the same general care requirements, though larger monkeys will need more space than the smaller ones.Apes, such a chimpanzees, gibbons and orangutans are not monkeys and should not be kept as pets. They are much stronger than humans and can become quite dangerous in a domestic situation. , Bringing a monkey into your home is almost as big a commitment as deciding to have a child. Monkeys require attention all day, every day, and unlike cats and dogs, they cannot be left at home for extended periods of time. Once your monkey bonds with you, he will want to follow you wherever you go, and if you try to leave him by himself he will become bored, depressed and aggressive. Monkeys can live for 20 to 40 years, so bringing one home is a commitment to spend a significant portion of your life providing for your monkey's needs. Before you decide to get a pet monkey, ponder the following facts about life with a monkey:The monkey may become aggressive. When monkeys are babies, they are dependent and sweet, like baby humans. But when they reach sexual maturity, which happens around age 3 or 4, their behavior can become unpredictable. Monkeys are wild animals, and unlike cats and dogs, they have not been socialized to live with humans over thousands of years. Even a monkey who has bonded with a human as a baby may unpredictably bite and attack his owner or become quite difficult to live with as an adult.You'll have to say goodbye to your free time. Monkeys cannot be left to their own devices. They need constant attention and care, or else they can end up hurting themselves or someone else. And since they tend to bond with just one person, it's difficult to find a good monkey-sitter when you need some time to yourself.Your monkey may prevent you from having relationships you want. Monkeys tend to bond with just a few people. Having a monkey might prevent you from getting intimately involved with potential partners to whom the monkey has a negative reaction. Monkeys don't get along well with children, so having a monkey could keep you from starting a family.All that said, if you are one of the unique people with the temperament and discipline it takes to devote your life to the safety and care of your monkey, you may be rewarded with an amazing experience. Monkeys are intelligent, endlessly entertaining, and sometimes incredibly affectionate. Many people who share their lives with monkeys embrace the challenges and wouldn't trade their time with their beloved pets for anything.  It is illegal to have a pet monkey in many states, and more states will probably pass laws against the practice in the future. For this reason, it's difficult to move to a new state or travel across state lines when you own a monkey. It's illegal to bring a monkey into the US, so that means you can't travel abroad with your monkey and then try to bring him home.Some states allow monkeys to be kept as pets, but have strict regulations as to the conditions under which the monkeys should be contained.Regulations regarding pet monkeys are different in countries outside the US. Look into the laws in your jurisdiction to find out whether there are any restrictions on which animals you can keep as pets.  When you've decided that it's time to get a monkey, do research in your area to find a dealer or breeder with an established reputation as someone who can be trusted. They should have a USDA permit number, which is required of all breeders in the United States.Ask the dealer or breeder for the contact information of someone else who has bought a monkey from them. That way you can check into the monkey's health and behavior.Expect to pay upwards of $1,000 for a monkey of any species. A baby squirrel monkey can cost over $8,000. Older monkeys are less expensive, but much more difficult to handle once you bring them home.Before you make a purchase, visit with the monkey you'd like to buy and make sure you have a connection and can see yourself living with the monkey.Never purchase a monkey from outside the country. It's illegal to ship a monkey from outside the United States.  Before you bring a monkey home, it's important to establish a relationship with an exotic animals veterinarian. A regular veterinarian will not have the necessary expertise and equipment to care for a monkey. Monkeys are prone to catching some of the same illnesses that humans have, as frequently as humans, so you can expect that your monkey will get sick from time to time. An exotic animals vet will also be a good resource for you when you have questions about your monkey's needs or behavioral issues.  Your pet monkey might spend time out of his cage, but he'll need a place to stay at night and during times when you aren't available to play. A monkey's cage should be quite large, the bigger the better.Monkeys need plenty of room to run around, explore and play, especially if they're going to spend more than an hour or two at a time in the cage. If the cage is too small, the monkey will become agitated and potentially aggressive.You can purchase a monkey cage, but many owners prefer to build their own so they can customize them to their personal space. Wooden or steel poles and chain-link fencing make good materials for monkey cages. You may want to have an outdoor monkey cage as well as one indoors, or build a monkey cage attached to a heated outdoor shed that will provide shelter for the monkey.Be sure to follow your state's regulations regarding the dimensions, entryways and locks on monkey cages. In some cases the regulations differ according to what type of monkey you own.Monkeys like to climb, so provide a cage with plenty of height. Add branches, hanging ropes, and other features that will allow your monkey to climb around the cage.  Most monkey owners allow their pets to spend time around the house, rather than just in their cages. Monkeys are curious, intelligent creatures that will get into everything available to them, so you'll need to take the time to remove items that could cause them harm or suffer damage. Since monkeys can climb, your monkey-proofing will have to be more extensive than baby-proofing would be.Don't let monkeys have access to anything with a cord. Make sure all electronics are out of their reach.They'll tear down curtains, knock over lamps and chew on furniture. Put away any items you aren't comfortable letting them destroy.You might want to have one or two designated ""monkey rooms"" that the monkeys are allowed to play in, and have the rest of the house be off-limits. Remember that monkeys can turn doorknobs and open windows, so if you're planning to let the monkey stay there unsupervised, you'll need to make sure the room is as secure as a cage would be, with locks and bars on the windows.  Monkeys keep their own bodies clean, but they leave a mess wherever they go. They aren't easy to house-train, and they excrete whenever and wherever they choose. Some people put diapers on baby monkeys, but this isn't usually possible once the monkeys mature. Rather, you should plan on cleaning up after your monkey at least once a day to maintain sanitary conditions in the cage and in your home.  Monkeys should always have access to fresh water that they drink from clean water bottles. You can use baby bottles for this purpose. Some monkeys may prefer to take their water from a dish, and some might like to have both options. However you administer the water, make sure there's no chance the monkey will run out.  Monkey biscuits, or commercial monkey food, should be fed to your monkey every single day. These biscuits contain the right combination of vitamins and minerals to meet your monkey's needs. In addition to monkey biscuits, monkeys enjoy cut up fruit and fresh or steamed vegetables.You may also feed your monkey grasshoppers, mealworms, cooked chicken (with no spices), hard boiled eggs, yogurt, rice, grain and nuts.Do not feed your monkey anything that is considered ""junk food"" for a human. Sugary treats, ice cream, baked goods, snack foods, fast food, and raw meat should never be fed to a monkey.Depending on the type of monkey you have, you may also need to supplement his diet with extra vitamins. Monkeys kept inside may need extra vitamin D to account for the lack of sun exposure.  Monkeys need a lot of variety and stimulation in order to be happy. In the wild, they spend most of their time climbing around trees and looking for food. Simulate that experience in your monkey's cage and around the house by providing lots of interesting things for the monkey to play with and pull apart.Try hiding the monkey's food inside a box, or in a container with small holes that the monkey can reach one hand into. The monkey will have fun trying to figure out how to get to the food.Give the monkey stuffed animals, balls, and other toys to throw around and play with. Switch out the toys frequently so the monkey won't get bored.  Monkeys are social creatures, and when they're left alone for long periods of time they grow very unhappy. Spend a few hours playing with your monkey every single day. As you bond with your monkey, he'll start trusting you enough to climb up your body and give you hugs or even kisses.If you have more than one monkey, less social time is necessary. Many monkeys are happier living with others of their kind. If you can afford more than one, they'll live happily together in the same cage.  Hitting or yelling at a monkey will cause him to become afraid of you. It's also completely ineffective if you want to control your monkey's behavior. Remember that monkeys are wild, and they simply can't be trained to do exactly what you want them to do. From time to time they'll exhibit behaviors you might not like. Punishing them will only hurt your relationship.The best way to deal with negative behaviors is to make sure the monkey isn't lacking something that he needs to be content. Does he have enough stimulation every day? Is he getting plenty of exercise? Are you playing with him enough?Monkeys that are afraid or agitated might bite from time to time. Again, you can't deal with this by punishing the monkey. Instead, get to know his moods and learn to leave him alone when he might be in the mood to bite.  It's not a good idea to take your monkey out in public, or invite people to your home to play with him. Monkeys are too unpredictable. Your monkey can get taken away in an instant if an accident happens. If your monkey so much as scratches someone, an Animal Control officer has the right to confiscate him to test him for rabies. When exotic animals are confiscated, they are often euthanized, since there is no law requiring a quarantine period for exotic animals (as there is for domesticated animals like cats and dogs).If you have to go out of town and leave the monkey in someone else's care, make sure it's someone the monkey has met many times and has come to trust. Leaving the monkey with a total stranger could be stressful for him and lead to dangerous consequences.  Say his name when you feed him or offer them a toy, so he'll begin to learn it. When he responds, give him a treat and praise him. Teach him commands by showing him how to act. For example, if you say ""dance,"" start hopping around and dancing. When he learns a trick, give him treats and praise him.","['Monkeys are in the order of primates, which is divided into families of New World primates (smaller, tree-dwelling monkeys from South

Use fully secured bins. Don't feed monkeys. Pick the fruit from your trees. Monkey-proof all the houses. Avoid the use of plastic bags. Spread the word.,How to Repel Monkeys from Residential Areas1,"It is most likely that monkeys will be attracted to residential areas if they think they can access food easily. Before you think about installing any alarms or security devices to repel moneys you should make sure you are not encouraging them to enter your neighbourhood. The first thing to do is check that there are no open or inadequately secured bins which monkeys can gain easy access to.Use monkey-proof bins which can be properly secured and will not attract monkeys.You can secure bin lids with an elastic strap or bungee cord.Tie all refuse bags with a double-knot and make sure that no food waste is left lying around, or spilling out of the bins.Having easily accessible food in rubbish areas will encourage monkeys to move further into residential areas and even enter houses. , As well as ensuring that food waste and rubbish areas are closed off and monkey-proofed, it is essential that you and your neighbours do not feed monkeys in the area. If the monkeys get fed they will come back looking for more food. You can try to cut off their access to human sources of food so they continue to forage in their natural habitat not in urban areas.Do not feed monkeys or any other wild animals or you will attract them to where you live and make repelling them much harder.Preventing and discouraging the monkeys from entering human settlements is the most important first step.Once monkeys know there is a food source they are likely to visit every day.  If you have fruit trees around your house or in your neighbourhood don't forget that these are a potential food source that could attract monkeys. You should harvest any fruit trees as soon as possible in order to reduce the chances of monkeys finding the fruit.If this is a consistent problem, consider whether you should continue to cultivate fruit trees.If you are growing vegetables in the ground, be sure to cover them with a strong wire mesh that is designed to resist primates.  As well as securing all the bins, it is also important not to make it easy for monkeys to enter your house to look for food. To do this, ensure that all windows are secured. You can simply close the windows, or monkey-proof them with a mesh covering.Meshing a window and keeping food out of sight will discourage curious monkeys.  If you have monkeys in the area you should avoid using plastic bags as much as possible when you are walking around. Put any plastic bags inside canvas bags instead. Monkeys are curious and will snatch plastic bags which have food in and forage through rubbish bags. They can easily tear through the plastic so ensure they do not have the opportunity.

Respect the differences between a capuchin and more traditional pets. Educate yourself about capuchins. Recognize that capuchins were not meant to be quiet and isolated animals. Consider your capuchin’s needs to address why they are being so vocal.,How to Quiet a Capuchin Monkey1,"While dogs and cats have lived with humans for thousands of years, capuchins are wild animals and not domestic pets. As a result, you should not hold them to the same standards as traditional pets, expecting them to be tame and quiet.If you want a quiet pet, a capuchin might not be the right choice.While capuchins might seem docile, calm, and friendly as infants, they often become louder, unpredictable, and sometimes aggressive as adults. , The more you know about capuchins, the better you will be able to recognize what sort of behaviors or noises are normal and which ones might be an indication of a medical or emotional problem.Capuchins communicate with each other (or their human companions) using calls and vocalizations, which convey fear, excitement, happiness, and other emotions.Learn about their behavior in the wild and in captivity so you will be better able to interpret and understand these vocalizations.  In the wild, capuchins live in large, noisy groups of 10-35 primates.Since capuchins make noise in the wild, it is unreasonable and unfair to expect them to be quiet or silent in captivity.When kept in captivity, they are often more content in pairs.  If your capuchin’s needs aren’t being met, they might become very loud. Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind:Make sure they have large spaces to exercise, both indoors and outdoors.Capuchins also need a lot of mental stimulation, so provide them with toys and puzzles that you change out regularly so they are not bored and acting out.Ensure they have a varied and balanced diet. In addition to primate food, offer them fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, eggs, and insects.","['While dogs and cats have lived with humans for thousands of years, capuchins are wild animals and not domestic pets.', 'As a result, you should not hold them to the same standards as traditional pets, expecting them to be tame and quiet.', 'If you want a quiet pet, a capuchin might not be the right choice.', 'While capuchins might seem docile, calm, and friendly as infants, they often become louder, unpredictable, and sometimes aggressive as adults.', ', The more you know about capuchins, the better you will be able to recognize what sort of behaviors or noises are normal and which ones might be an indication of a medical or emotional problem.', 'Capuchins communicate with each other (or their human companions) using calls and vocalizations, which convey fear, excitement, happiness, and other emotions.', 'Learn about their behavior in the wild and in captivity so you will be better able to interpret and understand these vocalizations.', 'In the wild, capuchins live in large, noisy groups of 10-35 primates.', 'Since capuchins make noise in the wild, it is unreasonable and unfair to expect them to be quiet or silent in captivity.', 'When kept in captivity, they are often more content in pairs.', 'If your capuchin’s needs aren’t being met, they might become very loud.', 'Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind:Make sure they have large spaces to exercise, both indoors and outdoors.', 'Capuchins also need a lot of mental stimulation, so provide them with toys and puzzles that you change out regularly so they are not bored and acting out.', 'Ensure they have a varied and balanced diet.', 'In addition to primate food, offer them fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, eggs, and insects.']"
Get some privacy. Freshen your breath. Make her feel special. Make sure she’s ready for a kiss. Make physical contact. Avoid the common kissing pitfalls. Lean toward her until your faces are almost touching. Tilt your head slightly. Kiss her. Caress her cheeks and hair. Use your hands (a little bit). Don’t forget to breathe. Slowly pull away. End on a good note.,How to Kiss Your Girlfriend in Middle School,"Let’s face it. It may be hard to get complete privacy in middle school, but you have to do the best you can to make sure that you and your girlfriend can step away from your friends to get some time together. You could step outside during the school dance, find some solo time during a party, or even go out on a date together. Just do the best you can to make sure that there’s no chance that your friends can barge in and start making fun of you and ruin the mood.Avoid trying this in school for the first time. You’ve got to find a slightly more romantic location.This doesn’t mean you should try to kiss your girlfriend the second you’re alone together. The moment has to feel right, and privacy isn’t the only requirement for that. , If you’re ready to kiss your girlfriend, then your breath better be ready, too. You don’t have to make dramatic gestures and eat ten breath mints, but you should brush your teeth if you know you’re going to see your girlfriend soon. And if you’ve both just eaten a meal, just quickly chew a piece of gum. Don’t make a big deal about it or she’ll know that you’re self-conscious about kissing her.You can also put on some lip balm a few hours before to soften up your lips, but don’t use it right before you make a move or your lips won’t feel too pleasant.  Once you’ve got her alone, you can’t just swoop in for the kiss or it will feel a bit forced. Instead, you have to show your girlfriend that you care about her by making her feel special. Give her a compliment, like, “You look so pretty tonight,” or say something nice like, “I’ve had so much fun with you today.” You don’t have to try too hard to show her that you really do care about her. Turn off your phone, look into her eyes, and show her that she has your undivided attention.If you want to kiss your girlfriend, then she has to feel like you really like her for who she is, and that you see her as more than just a person to kiss.  Before you kiss your girlfriend, you have to make sure that you’re on the same page. This is probably your first kiss, and it may be her first kiss, too, so you really want her to feel ready to make this move with you. Though you don’t have to think of kissing her as a huge deal, it will be something she’ll remember, so you have to see if she’s into it. See if she’s moving closer to you, looks happy to see you, looks at your lips, and self-consciously touches her face or plays with her hair. This is a sign that she’s interested in kissing you and that she may be a little nervous.If she’s always trying to pull away when you’re alone together, and moves further and further away from you, then she may not be ready to take it to the next level with you. This doesn’t mean that she doesn’t like you, but it does mean that she’s not ready yet.  You shouldn’t go from standing two feet apart from your girlfriend to planting a big wet one on her face, or she’ll be caught off guard. Instead, move closer to her and make some physical contact. If you’re sitting, you can sit closer to her, put your hand on her knee, or play with her hair. If you’re standing, you can also touch her hair or her face, brush a hand along her waist, or just give her some kind of physical closeness to show that you’re ready to make a move.This will also be a good time to see if she’s ready. Does she respond well to your touch, move closer to you, or even initiate some touching?, If you’re kissing your girlfriend in middle school for the first time, there are a few things you may want to avoid:French kissing. This is not for everybody, and most people don’t start French kissing until high school. For your first kiss, keep the tongue out of it, or your girlfriend may be unpleasantly surprised. If you come out of the gate with a French kiss, it’ll be too much, too soon.The roaming hands. Just because your girlfriend is ready for a kiss doesn’t mean she’s ready for you to start creeping all over her body. You can touch her in safe, PG areas to show her that you care, but you don’t want to creep her out by suddenly touching her in a place where she’s definitely not ready to be touched.The sneak attack kiss. Avoid just jumping in and kissing her without any indication of what’s going to happen. Though some element of surprise is nice, you don’t want your girlfriend to not know what’s going on when you make your big move.  Once you’ve made physical contact, all you have to do is move a bit closer to her until your faces are very close together. If you’re sitting, then you’ll both have to turn your bodies a bit. If you’re standing, you can put your arms around her waist and move closer to her. This should happen slowly and naturally, and you can make eye contact while you get closer.You can lightly lick your lips a bit to soften them, if you’re not too obvious about it.  You don’t want to kiss your girlfriend head on, or your noses will get in the way. You should tilt your head slightly in one direction and she should tilt her head slightly in the other. Don’t worry if you don’t get it perfect the first time, or if you both don’t tilt your heads that much. This isn’t so crucial for a regular kiss, so don’t overthink it and tilt your head too much.  Here’s your big moment! Just lean forward a bit and make the connection, touching your lips to hers. Your lips won’t align perfectly, and you don’t have to worry about it. Relax your lips instead of puckering them, and just gently kiss your girlfriend’s lips. You can hold the kiss for a few seconds, or for as long as you both like.  This is something you can do while you kiss your girlfriend, if you don’t think it requires too much coordination. Just lightly run your hand over her cheeks or her hair while you’re kissing her. This can be something you do during Round Two, if you go in for another kiss after the first kiss is over.  While you’re kissing her, you can place your hands on her waist, her upper back, or her knee or shoulder if you’re sitting down. As long as you’re not touching her anywhere inappropriate, a little bit of touch can help the girl feel more in the moment. Don’t overwhelm her, though. If she’s not touching you except with her lips, only a bit of a light touch on your end will be enough.  This sounds silly, but it’s important. You may be so nervous or excited about finally kissing your girlfriend that you may forget to perform one of the most basic functions of the human being. That means breathing in and out, just as you normally would, while you’re kissing her. If you only kiss for a few seconds, breathing before and after is OK too.  After a few seconds, you can slowly pull away, while continuing to look into your girlfriend’s eyes. Don’t instantly pull away like you’ve been scorched by a flame. Instead, look at her, smile, and gently move away. You can brush her face or hair for an extra touch.  Let’s face it. Middle school can be awkward. Kissing for the first time can be weird. But you should do the best you can to make your girl feel comfortable, and to say something like, “That was nice,” to let her know it was a special moment for you. Don’t just take her hand and walk away to join the party and pretend it never happened. It can be hard for guys to express their feelings, but just do the best you can to make the girl feel special and to let her know you had a great time.And hey, nobody’s stopping you from going in for that second kiss! If the first kiss went well, it’s okay to pull away and to go back for more…and more again!","['Let’s face it.', 'It may be hard to get complete privacy in middle school, but you have to do the best

Practice kissing. Practice good oral hygiene. Have moist lips. Find the right moment. Keep your eyes closed. Avoid rushing. Relax. Decide that you are ready. Decide who you want to kiss. Talk with trusted friends. Ignore negative thoughts. Be confident. Understand that it is normal to be nervous. Keep a sense of humor.,How to Prepare for Your First Kiss,"This may sound silly, but practice pursing your lips. When you kiss, you don’t want them to be tightly pursed, as though you were kissing your grandma. On the other hand, you don't want them to be too relaxed either.Ideally, the first kiss will be soft but firm and passionate. , Having a clean, healthy mouth will make you more kissable. Having visibly dirty teeth and bad breath will likely keep people from wanting to kiss you.Make sure you brush twice each day, and floss at least once. It is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss, but for your own health as well.Have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person.Don’t chew gum. Although it will give you fresh breath, having gum in your mouth during your first kiss can make it more difficult to enjoy the moment because you will have to worry about where the gum is in your mouth.  If your lips are chapped and dry, the kiss will be less comfortable for both of you. Use a lip moisturizer, such as vaseline, regularly.If you are a girl, avoid sticky lip glosses. The person kissing you may find it weird and unenjoyable if your lips are very sticky and messy.  This is probably the hardest part of any first kiss. However, if you want to kiss the person you are with, look for signs that he or she wants to kiss you, too. Often, a good time is if you’ve been spending some time together alone, having good conversation.Are they making a lot of eye contact? Obviously, this doesn’t always mean they want to kiss you, but if they make a lot of eye contact, they at least find you interesting. If they want to kiss you, often they will be staring into your eyes or looking at your lips.What does their body language say? If they have their arms folded across their chest, then they probably don’t want a kiss; however, if they have their body angled towards you, are sitting or standing close to you with arms open, then it’s likely a good bet.Remember that this moment could be planned or it could happen spontaneously. Try to stay calm and go with the flow. There are certain moments where it is more likely. For example, if it is the end of the night just before you both go home, or if you are alone in a quiet moment.  Although it is OK to take a quick peek every now and then, it is usually better to keep your eyes closed. If your partner realizes you have your eyes open, he/she might feel uncomfortable.It will also help you to relax if your eyes are closed.  When the kiss happens, don’t immediately try to stick your tongue in his/her mouth. Instead, start out by gently kissing with just your lips, and if the kiss continues to that, proceed slowly. There is no need to rush when it comes to kissing.  The worst thing you can do is to over think your first kiss.Remember that no matter what happens, it is only one kiss, and there will be many others. Once you get the first kiss out of the way, you can practice getting better at it.Enjoy the moment! You only get one first kiss, and you will likely remember it for your entire life.Be present during the kiss. Don’t start thinking about how you can’t wait to tell your friends or write about it in your diary. Simply enjoy it.  Think about why you want to experience your first kiss? Is it because you think you have to in order to be “cool”? Or, is it because you feel that you actually want to have this experience?There might be many reasons you want to experience your first kiss, but in general it is a good idea to wait until you feel ready for it.  Choose someone that you feel comfortable with, and who wants to kiss you back. Typically, this will be your boyfriend or girlfriend, but in some cases it may also be a close friend who wants to have the experience too. Whoever it is, it will be more enjoyable if it is someone you trust and feel comfortable with.Although the cutest girl or boy in school might be an obvious choice, it doesn’t mean they are the best choice. You should choose someone you find attractive on the inside as much as the outside.  Ask trusted friends about their first kiss, and how they prepared themselves. Ask them what advice they can give you. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can also discuss it with your parents.Don't be afraid to ask questions. Almost every one can remember the nervousness and worries they had before their first kiss.  It's likely that you will be worrying about all the things that could go wrong during your first kiss. Ignore these thoughts.Instead, let yourself think only positive thoughts.For example, you can think about how you've taken good care of your lips and mouth, making you very kissable. You can think about how into you the person you will be kissing is, and how romantic it will be.  Although you will be nervous, remember that you deserve to be kissed! Believe that the kiss will go well, and although it may not go perfectly, it will all be OK.Remember that even if it doesn't go perfectly, it is only the first of many.  Nearly everyone feels nervous when kissing someone for the first time. This is a biological reaction to our excitement, and doesn’t mean anything bad.Remember that this also goes for the person kissing you back. It can sometimes be a comfort to remember the other person is also nervous.If you do your best to act relaxed about the kiss, it will help your partner relax too, and you can both enjoy it.  Often, the first kiss will be everything you hoped it would be despite the fact that it didn't go ""perfectly"". However, if things aren't turning out so well, don't get angry. Instead, pull away from your partner, and smile. It will help both of you relax, and you can try again if you want to.","['This may sound silly, but practice pursing your lips.', 'When you kiss, you don’t want them to be tightly pursed, as though you were kissing your grandma.', ""On the other hand, you don't want them to be too relaxed either."", 'Ideally, the first kiss will be soft but firm and passionate.', ', Having a clean, healthy mouth will make you more kissable.', 'Having visibly dirty teeth and bad breath will likely keep people from wanting to kiss you.', 'Make sure you brush twice each day, and floss at least once.', 'It is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss, but for your own health as well.', 'Have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person.', 'Don’t chew gum.', 'Although it will give you fresh breath, having gum in your mouth during your first kiss can make it more difficult to enjoy the moment because you will have to worry about where the gum is in your mouth.', 'If your lips are chapped and dry, the kiss will be less comfortable for both of you.', 'Use a lip moisturizer, such as vaseline, regularly.', 'If you are a girl, avoid sticky lip glosses.', 'The person kissing you may find it weird and unenjoyable if your lips are very sticky and messy.', 'This is probably the hardest part of any first kiss.', 'However, if you want to kiss the person you are with, look for signs that he or she wants to kiss you, too.', 'Often, a good time is if you’ve been spending some time together alone, having good conversation.', 'Are they making a lot of eye contact?', 'Obviously, this doesn’t always mean they want to kiss you, but if they make a lot of eye contact, they at least find you interesting.', 'If they want to kiss you, often they will be staring into your eyes or looking at your lips.', 'What does their body language say?', 'If they have their arms folded across their chest, then they probably don’t want a kiss;

Scare them off. Build an electric fence. Deploy an electronic sound repellent.,How to Repel Monkeys from Residential Areas2,"If you do find a monkey has entered a residential area you shouldn't panic, but you should be prepared. Keep some big sticks, a hose, or another water spraying device handy at home. If you see a monkey you can scare if off without harming it. Monkeys will quickly learn that your neighbourhood is not a good place for them to return to.Do not approach the monkey directly, do not stare at it, and do not try to corner it.Identify an exit and encourage the monkey to leave by hitting the ground with a stick. Never hit a monkey. A strong jet of water directed toward the monkey can also encourage it towards the exit.If there are juveniles in a group of monkeys be especially cautious. Lower your head, keep your distance and move away.  In extreme circumstances, it might be necessary to construct an electric fence around your settlement to stop monkeys from entering. This is not a straightforward task, and you should ensure you have taken the less dramatic steps of securing all bins and closing off any food sources before considering this. There is evidence that electric fences are effective at containing monkeys, and are unlikely to harm the animals if done correctly, but you will need expert help for this.If you think your monkey problem is this serious, contact a local government representative and ask them about electric fencing.If will not be cheap and in no circumstances should you attempt this on your own.  Increasingly, places and institutions frequented by monkeys are turning to ultrasound repellent devices to ward off the monkeys. These devices tend to be used where there are lots of people coming and going and it is hard to ensure that no rubbish or food waste is left accessible to monkeys in the area.The sounds cause stress and discomfort for monkeys in the area, who will move away and avoid the sound.The impact on the monkey's health and well-being is uncertain, and the preventative methods should be used in the first instance.","[""If you do find a monkey has entered a residential area you shouldn't panic, but you should be prepared."", 'Keep some big sticks, a hose, or another water spraying device handy at home.', 'If you see a monkey you can scare if off without harming it.', 'Monkeys will quickly learn that your neighbourhood is not a good place for them to return to.', 'Do not approach the monkey directly, do not stare at it, and do not try to corner it.', 'Identify an exit and encourage the monkey to leave by hitting the ground with a stick.', 'Never hit a monkey.', 'A strong jet of water directed toward the monkey can also encourage it towards the exit.', 'If there are juveniles in a group of monkeys be especially cautious.', 'Lower your head, keep your distance and move away.', 'In extreme circumstances, it might be necessary to construct an electric fence around your settlement to stop monkeys from entering.', 'This is not a straightforward task, and you should ensure you have taken the less dramatic steps of securing all bins and closing off any food sources before considering this.', 'There is evidence that electric fences are effective at containing monkeys, and are unlikely to harm the animals if done correctly, but you will need expert help for this.', 'If you think your monkey problem is this serious, contact a local government representative and ask them about electric fencing.', 'If will not be cheap and in no circumstances should you attempt this on your own.', 'Increasingly, places and institutions frequented by monkeys are turning to ultrasound repellent devices to ward off the monkeys.', 'These devices tend to be used where there are lots of people coming and going and it is hard to ensure that no rubbish or food waste is left accessible to monkeys in the area.', 'The sounds cause stress and discomfort for monkeys in the area, who will move away and avoid the sound.', ""The impact on the monkey's health and well-being is uncertain, and the preventative methods should be used in the first instance.""]"
Make sure you have ample space so that capuchins can burn off energy and be less noisy. Find your capuchin a friend. Provide your capuchin with interesting toys and puzzles to keep them occupied. Give your capuchin a mirror to occupy their attention. Offer your capuchin foods that take time and attention to eat. Make time for your capuchin.,How to Quiet a Capuchin Monkey2,"When they receive the physical exercise they need, capuchins will be more content and quiet.Capuchins need sufficient space to walk around in, climb, and jump.Provide them places to sit so that their tail hangs below their seat without dragging on the floor.Their cage size should be larger than 4ft. x 6ft. x 6ft, but if you have the space, an entire room would be more appropriate for your capuchin.“Cat trees” that you purchase at pet stores also make excellent monkey trees.  If your capuchin is loud and seems unhappy, it might be lonely and need companionship. Capuchins are social animals and they live longer, happier lives in captivity if they are not isolated.Consider adopting another capuchin to keep your pet company.Capuchin monkeys also get along well with other species such as squirrel monkeys, so this is also an option for a companion.If you have to leave your capuchin alone, turn the television on and they will be less lonely and noisy while you are gone.  Your capuchin might be vocalizing and acting out because it is bored and needs mental stimulation. To occupy and quiet your capuchin monkey, try out these toys or objects.Tire swings and climbing ropes provide them with a lot of entertainment.Capuchins like to handle things and tear them, so give them soft items such as cardboard.Make sure the toys do not have sharp edges or hazardous coatings.Capuchins like things that are bright and shiny.  Like other primates, capuchins are known to spend considerable time playing with their reflections in a mirror. This will provide great entertainment for your pet and help keep your capuchin quiet.Use a metal mirror instead of glass so your capuchin is not hurt if the glass breaks.  Provide your pet with food that doubles as entertainment and keeps them occupied.Give them fruits, seeds, or nuts that they have to crack, peel, or separate.A piece of fruit frozen in ice or a cob of corn will entertain and stimulate your capuchin, making him or her less likely to be noisy.For a fun treat, hide peanut butter and honey in a PVC pipe or box and give your capuchin a straw or stick to retrieve it. They will spend time focusing on this task instead of acting out.  It’s possible that your pet capuchin is being rowdy and noisy because it wants your attention.Take time every day to play with your capuchin.","['When they receive the physical exercise they need, capuchins will be more content and quiet.', 'Capuchins need sufficient space to walk around in, climb, and jump.', 'Provide them places to sit so that their tail hangs below their seat without dragging on the floor.', 'Their cage size should be larger than 4ft. x 6ft. x 6ft, but if you have the space, an entire room would be more appropriate for your capuchin.', '“Cat trees” that you purchase at pet stores also make excellent monkey trees.', 'If your capuchin is loud and seems unhappy, it might be lonely and need companionship.', 'Capuchins are social animals and they live longer, happier lives in captivity if they are not isolated.', 'Consider adopting another capuchin to keep your pet company.', 'Capuchin monkeys also get along well with other species such as squirrel monkeys, so this is also an option for a companion.', 'If you have to leave your capuchin alone, turn the television on and they will be less lonely and noisy while you are gone.', 'Your capuchin might be vocalizing and acting out because it is bored and needs mental stimulation.', 'To occupy and quiet your capuchin monkey, try out these toys or objects.', 'Tire swings and climbing ropes provide them with a lot of entertainment.', 'Capuchins like to handle things and tear them, so give them soft items such as cardboard.', 'Make sure the toys do not have sharp edges or hazardous coatings.', 'Capuchins like things that are bright and shiny.', 'Like other primates, capuchins are known to spend considerable time playing with their reflections in a mirror.', 'This will provide great entertainment for your pet and help keep your capuchin quiet.', 'Use a metal mirror instead of glass so your capuchin is not hurt if the glass breaks.', 'Provide your pet with food that doubles as entertainment and keeps them occupied.', 'Give them fruits, seeds, or nuts that they have to crack, peel, or separate.', 'A piece of fruit frozen in ice or a cob of corn will entertain and stimulate your capuchin, making him or her less likely to be noisy.', 'For a fun treat, hide peanut butter and honey in a PVC pipe or box and give your capuchin a straw or stick to retrieve it.', 'They will spend time focusing on this task instead of acting out.', 'It’s possible that your pet capuchin is being rowdy and noisy because it wants your attention.', 'Take time every day to play with your capuchin.']"
"Bond with your capuchin. Demonstrate that you are in charge. Reward your capuchin’s good, quiet behavior. Use time outs to punish your capuchin when they are loud. Do not resort to physical discipline to quiet your capuchin. Be consistent with your commands, especially when you want them to be quiet. Ask an expert for help.",How to Quiet a Capuchin Monkey3,"The success of training a capuchin to be quiet will depend on whether or not your capuchin respects you and bonds with you. Here are a few important things to keep in mind to increase the strength of your bond.Every time you go near your pet’s cage, stop and speak to your monkey.Call it by name.Offer it food or a treat.Make sure you care for your capuchin’s needs and play with them daily.Be patient because capuchins are known to be wary of strangers. Don’t expect to bond with them and train them overnight.  To get your capuchin to listen and follow your commands to be quiet, you need to show your pet that you are in a dominant position.Feeding, caring for, and playing with your capuchin will show them you are in charge of their care, and they will depend on you.Be kind, but firm.Do not use physical force to emphasize your point because your capuchin might respond aggressively and lose trust.  When your capuchin is quiet and calm, make sure you offer positive reinforcement in the form of a treat or praise.Marshmallows, yogurt covered raisins, mealworms, or another favorite food works well.You can also use a new toy or object your capuchin will find interesting.  If your capuchin is behaving badly and won't be quiet, put your pet in their cage, and walk away. Do not look at your capuchin or interact with it for about 15 minutes.This teaches your capuchin that their behavior is unacceptable.Because capuchins are social creatures, they will find this time out upsetting and try to avoid it in the future.  Physical punishment is not effective since capuchins often interpret this as a threat and respond aggressively.Taking these actions jeopardizes your relationship with your pet.Physical discipline often results in more negative, and violent behavior such as biting.If you feel yourself getting frustrated with your capuchin, it’s best to take a break so you don’t lose your temper.  Use the same commands or words with specific actions so that your capuchin will associate the action with the command.For example use “Quiet” when you want your capuchin to be quiet. Don’t change things and start using the command “Silent.”, If your efforts to quiet your capuchin don’t seem to be working and they are unusually loud, it’s a good idea to ask for help from an expert.Get in touch with your veterinarian to make sure your pet is not ill or injured.Contact an animal trainer. Although specialized trainers might be difficult to locate in your area, it is worth researching online.For additional resources and communication with experts, join the Simian Society of America, a nonprofit organization established to improve the welfare of primates in captivity.","['The success of training a capuchin to be quiet will depend on whether or not your capuchin respects you and bonds with you.', 'Here are a few important things to keep in mind to increase the strength of your bond.', 'Every time you go near your pet’s cage, stop and speak to your monkey.', 'Call it by name.', 'Offer it food or a treat.', 'Make sure you care for your capuchin’s needs and play with them daily.', 'Be patient because capuchins are known to be wary of strangers.', 'Don’t expect to bond with them and train them overnight.', 'To get your capuchin to listen and follow your commands to be quiet, you need to show your pet that you are in a dominant position.', 'Feeding, caring for, and playing with your capuchin will show them you are in charge of their care, and they will depend on you.', 'Be kind, but firm.', 'Do not use physical force to emphasize your point because your capuchin might respond aggressively and lose trust.', 'When your capuchin is quiet and calm, make sure you offer positive reinforcement in the form of a treat or praise.', 'Marshmallows, yogurt covered raisins, mealworms, or another favorite food works well.', 'You can also use a new toy or object your capuchin will find interesting.', ""If your capuchin is behaving badly and won't be quiet, put your pet in their cage, and walk away."", 'Do not look at your capuchin or interact with it for about 15 minutes.', 'This teaches your capuchin that their behavior is unacceptable.', 'Because capuchins are social creatures, they will find this time out upsetting and try to avoid it in the future.', 'Physical punishment is not effective since capuchins often interpret this as a threat and respond aggressively.', 'Taking these actions jeopardizes your relationship with your pet.', 'Physical discipline often results in more negative, and violent behavior such as biting.', 'If you feel yourself getting frustrated with your capuchin, it’s best to take a break so you don’t lose your temper.', 'Use the same commands or words with specific actions so that your capuchin will associate the action with the command.', 'For example use “Quiet” when you want your capuchin to be quiet.', 'Don’t change things and start using the command “Silent.”', ', If your efforts to quiet your capuchin don’t seem to be working and they are unusually loud, it’s a good idea to ask for help from an expert.', 'Get in touch with your veterinarian to make sure your pet is not ill or injured.', 'Contact an animal trainer.', 'Although specialized trainers might be difficult to locate in your area, it is worth researching online.', 'For additional resources and communication with experts, join the Simian Society of America, a nonprofit organization established to improve the welfare of primates in captivity.']"

Get near them. Say hi to your crush. Compliment your crush. Talk about the dance. Keep the conversation short if you’re dancing. Give non-verbal cues that you want to dance.,How to Get Your Crush to Dance With You at a School Dance2,"If your crush is on the other side of the room, move to the general vicinity they are in. If they are sitting down, go sit down at a nearby table with some friends. If you and your friends are friends with your crush, join them where they are sitting, and try to make sure that you are sitting next to your crush. If they are dancing, dance with a group of your friends either in a group next to your crush, or join their group of friends.Hanging out near your crush before you approach them makes going up and talking to them less abrupt and more natural.  Say hello to your crush and ask them how they are doing. Say something like, “Hey Jamie, how are you?” or “Hey, what’s up?” If you’ve never talked to your crush before, introduce yourself.If at this point, your crush’s friends and your friends are hanging out together, it should be easy talk to him or her.If your crush is with his or her friends, approach them with some of your friends.

While your friends talk to your crush’s friends, you can talk to your crush.If you and your friends don’t know your crush’s friends well enough to talk with them, wait to talk to your crush when they are alone getting food, checking their phone or coming back from the bathroom.  Giving your crush a compliment is a good way of keeping the conversation going. Since it’s a dance, your crush probably put a lot of time into their appearance, so complimenting them will make them feel happy that someone noticed.Say something like. “You look nice” or “I like your dress.”, If you don’t know what else to talk about with your crush, just talk about the dance!You could ask them how they are enjoying the dance by saying something like, “So are you having fun?”You could also talk about something specific about the dance by saying something like, “I really like the decorations that they put up!” or “Have you tried the punch? It’s really good.”, If you and your friends are on the dancefloor near your crush and you start talking to your crush, don’t go on and on. A lot of people talk on the dancefloor while dancing, but the dancefloor isn’t the right place for a long conversation, since your crush might be more in the mood to dance than to talk.If your crush seems like they are into the conversation, by all means keep talking. However, if you are doing most of the talking, keep in mind that your crush may be more in the mood to dance.  If you are talking to your crush while you both are sitting down, allow for pauses in the conversation and look over to the dancefloor as you pause. This is a non-verbal way of indicating that you are interested in dancing. You can also tap your feet or move a little to the music to show that you like the song. If your crush wants to dance with you, they may pick up on these cues and ask you to dance.If you are talking to your crush while dancing, a pause is also a good way to give them a window to ask you to dance.Giving non-verbal cues is a good method for girls to use if they don’t feel comfortable asking a guy to dance.

Wait until the right song. Ask your crush. Encourage them if they are nervous. Keep a respectable distance at first. Read your crush’s body language. Get closer. Assess the situation at the end of the song.,How to Get Your Crush to Dance With You at a School Dance3,"If your crush hasn’t already asked you to dance, it may be time to take matters into your own hands. If you are sitting and talking to your crush, wait until a song comes on that you want to dance to before asking them. For example, you may wait for a slow song or a song that has a good rhythm.If you are already dancing, you may not have as big of a window to ask them to dance, since your conversation may be shorter. If you absolutely hate the song playing, or you feel like it’s too fast to dance to with your crush, try to keep the conversation going until the next song comes on.  When a song comes on you like, ask your crush, “Do you want to dance?” Keep the tone of your voice light and casual, and make sure to smile as you ask them.Always ask, even if you are dancing near each other. Unless your crush starts dancing close to you, don’t go up and start dancing in front of or against them. Asking them is cute and polite, whereas starting to dance up in their space can be pushy and creepy.If you’re a girl, don’t let society’s norms stop you from asking your crush to dance! There’s a good chance that they will say yes, and be flattered that you asked.  Many people get nervous about dancing, so your crush may be hesitant to dance even if they like you. If they say something like, ""I'm not really good at dancing"", offer to teach them some moves that are easy to follow. Even showing them over-the-top moves like ""the sprinkler"" is a good way to be goofy and get them comfortable. Your crush will feel less pressure if they know that you aren't expecting them to look suave or cool.School dances often play songs that have specific steps. If your crush doesn't want to dance to regular songs, wait until one comes on like the electric slide that follows a routine, and offer to show them how to dance to it.If you don't know any specific moves or dance steps, you can also just say, ""It's ok, I'm a terrible dancer so I won't judge."" This is a good way of making your crush feel more at ease and willing to dance.  If your crush says yes, start dancing with them. However, don’t get too close. If you are slow dancing, keep about a foot between yourselves. If you are dancing to a fast song, still try to keep some space between you two.  Try to see if your crush is enjoying the dance and wants to get closer. For instance, your crush could close some of the distance between the two of you, or if you are slow dancing they could wrap their arms to hold you closer. They also may look you in the eye and smile, which would be a good indication that they want to get closer.  You’ve been dancing at a respectful distance. However, you may see that your crush is enjoying the dance and seems like they would be comfortable getting closer. If you are slow dancing, hold them a little closer to you. If you are dancing to a fast song, move and inch or two nearer to them.  Once the song ends, see if your crush wants to dance for another song. If they stay close to you, or start dancing as soon as the new song comes on, it means that they would like to keep dancing. If they move away or give you a hug, it could mean that they enjoyed the dance, but they want to take a break.You can always ask, “Do you want to keep dancing?” if you’re not sure how they are feeling.","['If your crush hasn’t already asked you to dance, it may be time to take matters into your own hands.', 'If you are sitting and talking to your crush, wait until a song comes on that you want to dance to before asking them.', 'For example, you may wait for a slow song or a song that has a good rhythm.', 'If you are already dancing, you may not have as big of a window to ask them to dance, since your conversation may be shorter.', 'If you absolutely hate the song playing, or you feel like it’s too fast to dance to with your crush, try to keep the conversation going until the next song comes on.', 'When a song comes on you like, ask your crush, “Do you want to dance?”', 'Keep the tone of your voice light and casual, and make sure to smile as you ask them.', 'Always ask, even if you are dancing near each other.', 'Unless your crush starts dancing close to you, don’t go up and start dancing in front of or against them.', 'Asking them is cute and polite, whereas starting to dance up in their space can be pushy and creepy.', 'If you’re a girl, don’t let society’s norms stop you from asking your crush to dance!', 'There’s a good chance that they will say yes, and be flattered that you asked.', 'Many people get nervous about dancing, so your crush may be hesitant to dance even if they like you.', 'If they say something like, ""I\'m not really good at dancing"", offer to teach them some moves that are easy to follow.', 'Even showing them over-the-top moves like ""the sprinkler"" is a good way to be goofy and get them comfortable.', ""Your crush will feel less pressure if they know that you aren't expecting them to look suave or cool."", 'School dances often play songs that have specific steps.', ""If your crush doesn't want to dance to regular songs, wait until one comes on like the electric slide that follows a routine, and offer to show them how to dance to it."", 'If you don\'t know any specific moves or dance steps, you can also just say, ""It\'s ok, I\'m a terrible dancer', 'so I won\'t judge.""', 'This is a good way of making your crush feel more at ease and willing to dance.', 'If your crush says yes, start dancing with them.', 'However, don’t get too close.', 'If you are slow dancing, keep about a foot between yourselves.', 'If you are dancing to a fast song, still try to keep some space between you two.', 'Try to see if your crush is enjoying the dance and wants to get closer.', 'For instance, your crush could close some of the distance between the two of you, or if you are slow dancing they could wrap their arms to hold you closer.', 'They also may look you in the eye and smile, which would be a good indication that they want to get closer.', 'You’ve been dancing at a respectful distance.', 'However, you may see that your crush is enjoying the dance and seems like they would be comfortable getting closer.', 'If you are slow dancing, hold them a little closer to you.', 'If you are dancing to a fast song, move and inch or two nearer to them.', 'Once the song ends, see if your crush wants to dance for another song.', 'If they stay close to you, or start dancing as soon as the new song comes on, it means that they would like to keep dancing.', 'If they move away or give you a hug, it could mean that they enjoyed the dance, but they want to take a break.', 'You can always ask, “Do you want to keep dancing?”', 'if you’re not sure how they are feeling.']"

You may not realize it, but you have a lot to offer that particular boy you’re aiming to kiss, no matter how awesome or cute he is.Appreciate all your qualities, not only your looks. This can range from your vocabulary and social skills to your passions and hobbies. If you feel confident on one particular aspect of yourself more than others, use that as a starting point and expand. , A great way to inspire and maintain confidence is to wear an outfit you’re more than proud of. Pick out a top and bottom you think you could wear anywhere, whether that be a fancy restaurant or over to a friend’s house.It’s easy to dress to the point that it appears as if you’re trying too hard. Don’t dress in your Sunday best or Prom ready, but wear an outfit you’re sure will grab his attention. Boys rarely dissect what women wear, they only know if they like it or not.  Style your hair in a way that makes you feel confident. Maybe you like to frame your face with bangs? Maybe you feel the most confident with straightened hair? Pick the one you feel the most confident in.Like clothes, guys will rarely nitpick your hair and notice small imperfections. They’ll only know that it looks good or bad, so a little effort goes a long way.  Rock a luscious lip balm, lip-gloss or lipstick to make sure he notices how kissable your lips are. Pick a color that suits your skin tone and clothing selection. Maybe a deep, full red helps brighten your eyes or a light pink really suits the top you’ve picked out. Again, make a selection you're confident in.These cosmetics will also help smooth – or at least bring attention to – any sort of chapped portions of your lips. The last thing you want to do is be ready to go in for the kiss and notice how rough and cracked they are.  Freshen up your perfume and breath before you intend to meet your potential kissing mate. Smelling nice – both in and out of your mouth – goes a long way in creating an inviting, welcoming persona. One of the most memorable features in people is their specific aroma – make sure yours is a good one.There’s a chance your boy will not take this into consideration when it comes to breath. It’s always helpful to pack some gum or mints before meeting up with your new kissing mate. If needed, you can have one and even offer one to the boy you intend on kissing.  Nothing says you’re interested like a little flirtation. If you’re confident, interesting, look the part and have created a welcoming moment, flirting can even open the possibility of your boy going for the kiss himself.Smile. Nothing creates a friendly persona like a smile. A smile indicates you’re happy and interested to be talking. Boys need all the positive reinforcement they can get, so a smile can go a long way. A smile will also subtly draw his attention to your mouth, something he’ll hopefully become intimate with! Make light contact. Subtly touching your boy will drop an even larger hint that you’re interested. Lightly touch his arm, shoulder, hand, or chest during conversation or even lightly, “accidentally” bump into him while walking. Even minimal contact will draw his attention and let him know you’re flirting. Plus, when you’re ready to move in for the kiss, the touching “barrier” between the two of you will already be broken.Pay him compliments. Guys, like girls, need all the positive reinforcement they can get. Complimenting features you find attractive or beautiful, be it his hair, personality, sense of humor, eyes, muscles, or intelligence, can go a long way in letting him know you want to take things to the next level. , Ask your boy out on a date or a group date. If you don’t think he’ll go for that, meet up with him while he’s with his friends or while you’re with your friends. You can also suggest meeting up at a party. In any case, it’s important to eliminate as many spectators as possible to create a more intimate, “kiss worthy” moment.Make it easy for him to get you alone. Try not to include your friends if you’re meeting up. Guys are often leery about making contact with a girl when her friends surround her, as they often do not share the same opinion about a particular boy. Remember, guys need as much positive reinforcement as possible. Girls can often serve as static to this situation, one you’d prefer to be crystal clear.Suggest the two of you go for a walk together. There’s nothing like spending some time outside, be it outside of a party or just enjoying the day. A walk provides the perfect opportunity to create a kissing environment and utilize your flirting abilities.Offer to help with tedious chores or errands. If your boy is buying groceries, grabbing a cup of coffee, cleaning or paying bills, offer to be his copilot. This situation will not only demonstrate interest, but offer a perfect chance to be alone.  Make sure your body language is open, welcoming and reinforcing. How you carry yourself will send either the right or wrong signals to your kissing mate. Make sure your shoulders are facing him if sitting next to him, that you’re visibly interested in what he’s talking about (smiling and nodding are good for this), and that you’re maintaining light contact.Avoid crossing your arms, tightly crossing your legs, twiddling your thumbs, or constantly clasping your hands together. These indicate you could be bored with the conversation, anxious to leave, or that you’re generally not enjoying yourself. This is the last thing you want to do when you’re trying to kiss a boy. Don’t be afraid to show how nervous you are. A healthy bit of nervousness can show your boy how excited you are to be around him. The most obvious signs can act as positive reinforcement and physically articulate how much you like him and are enjoying yourself.  Do not force the situation, especially if you’re not sure if your boy is ready to be kissed. When the time is right, chances are he’ll be doing the exact same things you are to ensure a kiss will happen.Be prepared to create more opportunities to be alone. Your first get-together with your potential kissing mate may not go as planned. Do not be discouraged – your boy may need more obvious hints or efforts to fully comprehend what’s going on. Remember to stay confident and patient.  It’s important that you lock eyes with your intended kissing mate. Not only does eye contact create an intimate moment, it can also drop the hint that you’re ready to do more than talk.Locking eyes can create that particular romantic moment you’re looking for with your boy. Such a moment can break the barrier and change a meet up from casual to ideal for kissing. , Find a reason or excuse to be close to your boy. If you’re out walking, say you’re cold. If you’re sitting somewhere, use the same excuse! When you’re sure the moment is right, find any excuse to be close to your boy’s lips.Being close to your boy can serve as an indication of how interested or ready to kiss he is. Be prepared to maintain your patience if you don’t get the reaction you desire. He may need a bit more time.  If you’re unsure whether or not your boy is ready to fully smooch, break the kiss barrier with a kiss on the cheek. The way your boy reacts may indicate whether or not he’s ready to kiss you, be it later on in the night or the next time you see him.Make sure he knows it’s not just a friendly kiss. Instead of simply pecking him on the cheek, linger a bit during the kiss. Make sure your lips feel soft against a good spot on his cheek. It’s important that even this kiss is memorable, so do it somewhere close to his ear or near his mouth.  After you’re close and have maintained eye contact, your boy should get the hint that you’re ready for a full-on smooch. Make sure your lips are light and soft, welcoming him to take the lead if needed. Line up your nose with his nose and turn slightly to the right or left to avoid collision. In any case, a light kiss will be much more welcoming and enjoyable to your boy over a hard, deep kiss. A good technique to use is to lean in, and right before your lips meet his, hold off a bit. This will create a sense of longing in your boy and allow him to close the gap. This way, you’ll know for sure that the situation is mutual.If you make your lips into a tight pucker, you may send the wrong signal. This may indicate you were not ready for a full kiss or that you’re generally not enjoying it and uncomfortable with what’s happening.  You can put your hands to great use and indicate – and even increase – the level of enjoyment by letting your hands roam. Run your hands along the back of his head, lightly caress his neck, or even let your fingers run through his hair during the kiss.Your hands can also pull your boy in closer to heighten the level of the kiss and make it easier to maneuver around each other’s faces.Make sure you’re not too rough or forward when caressing his neck, back or hair, as it may send the wrong signal. Remember, you’re just at the kissing stage with your boy. Other sorts of affections will come later and when you're ready.  After you’ve initiated the first kiss, you can also add more variety to the situation by changing the way you kiss. You can begin by lightly changing the intensity and speed in which you’re kissing. The trick is to keep the kissing interesting and enjoyable rather than long and tedious.You can significantly up your kissing game by lightly sucking on your boys lower lip. If he likes it, chances are he’ll return the favor. This technique can heighten the experience for the both of you and make the situation that much more memorable. Remember, never make it too intense, as you don’t want to make the situation memorable in an awkward way.  Nothing makes a kiss more memorable than transforming it to a French kiss. A French kiss is reminiscent of all those black and white Hollywood hits and has really become the standard when it comes to romance.To French kiss, you open your mouth slightly – only enough to ease your tongue through – before lightly touching his lips with it. Don’t let your tongue linger for too long.If your boy returns the gesture, he’s ready to French kiss. The rest of the kiss involves turning your head slightly to the side to avoid nose and teeth collision.Move your tongue into his mouth and lightly caress his tongue with yours. Chances are, he’ll be doing the same thing. Remember to keep your tongue moving, otherwise it will simply be resting inside his mouth!Be sure to change the pace and intensity while French kissing. Like a normal kiss, the moment can quickly move from passionate and romantic to boring and tedious if kept too routine.  Make sure you leave your boy wanting more. If you’ve utilized your hands, tried a few kissing techniques, and let the kiss linger, chances are it was a fun and enjoyable experience. If your boy enjoyed it, he’ll want to do it again and soon. Let him wonder when the next encounter will be!","['Confidence shows a boy you’re fully committed to engaging with him physically.', 'Boys can be lazy, so showing a certain amount of confidence and

"Before you do anything else, find out a little more about your crush. Make sure your crush is aware of your existence. Make yourself available. Tweak your style to perk your crush's interest. Take care of your hygiene. Make sure you appear in several of the classes in your crush's schedule. Start friendly, comfortable conversations with your crush, and ask nice questions about him that will help you get to know more about him. Slowly start to sit at your crush's table. At this point, if you've become good enough friends with your crush so that you're a part of his daily life and attention now, your crush should be naturally starting conversations with you instead of you doing all the starting. Finished.",How to Get Your Crush to Be the Conversation Starter,"Either strike up the courage to ask him yourself, or get the information from someone else.Make sure you are aware if he is single or not.You may want to get someone else to ask him for you, or ask one of his friends that you trust and are comfortable with. Make sure it's not obvious that you're interested in him, or there may be trouble!If you find out that he already has a girlfriend, immediately back off. If his girlfriend suspects that you are trying to win him over, or she believes that he is cheating on her, there could be plenty of trouble, and you wouldn't want to get mixed up in that!Your crush could also misunderstand your intentions, and think less of you.Scope out where he usually sits, and who he usually sits with.Familiarize yourself with his likes and dislikes.Know his taste, and what types of girls he is interested in. , When you pass by him in the hallways, smile softly, and greet him with a simple, ""Hey."" If he smiles and greets you back, that's a good sign. If he ignores you, keep trying for a little bit, then stop if it's obvious he isn't interested in you.Not only does this step ensure that your crush is aware of your existence, but it will also begin your relationship with him!Make sure you don't overuse this step, as it will get a little creepy!When you smile, don't smile widely, or you'll appear a little freakish. A soft, small but noticeable smile will make you look pretty, and he'll think of you as an approachable, friendly person.  On all of your social networks and websites, label yourself as ""single"". Include casually that you're single in all of your profile pages. Go even further, and - if possible - wear a single bracelet!, You don't have to completely change it just for him, but try playing around with hairstyles and clothing till you find a good balance between what you feel comfortable in and what he likes to see girls wear.For example: If your crush likes sporty girls and/or sports, wear a baseball cap or shirt (his favorite team, if possible).Try to connect your style with his likes so that you form a link!If he notices your clothing, and either compliments and/or asks you about it (ex: ""Are you a Steelers' fan?""), play it cool, and act like it was a coincidence that you wore what he liked. However, try not to lie or make a habit of it.  You don't need to go overboard, and stock up on all the perfumes and take a shower every hour that passes, but be clean and show him that you take good care of your body. Follow the steps below for good hygiene:Take a shower every single day, using lukewarm water and an effective, nice-smelling soap. Spend no more than six minutes each time you take a shower, and make sure you scrub, not soak.For soft skin, moisturize your entire body exactly fifteen minutes after you take your shower. This will enhance your skin very well!Wash your hair no more than three times a week with an effective shampoo and conditioner, making sure they contain the proper, natural ingredients your hair type requires. Washing your hair too frequently can cause it to become oily, stinky, and dried up. No guy likes gross hair! Beware of washing your hair too few times as well.If it appears that your shampoo and conditioner aren't working as well on your hair as you would like them to, try switching to a different brand or type that suits your hair type well.Brush your teeth in the morning and at night with an effective toothpaste. Use mouthwash in the morning before you leave for school, and make sure you floss every day at night.If you wear braces, make sure to take extra good care of your teeth!Use a body and hand lotion that uses natural ingredients with no harmful chemicals in it. This will help make your skin smoother and softer, tempting your crush to want to feel how nice it is (he may or may not, depending on his personality and confidence).Cleanse your face with a good cleanser twice a day - morning and night. Make sure your cleanser isn't too strong, or you'll experience more frequent outbreaks of nasty pimples. Rinse well with lukewarm water. Follow with toner and moisturizer.Don't deprive your pimples of moisturizer, as they actually need plenty of moisture in order to heal effectively and quickly. However, be careful not to use too much moisturizer on them!, You can either casually ask him ahead of time what classes he is planning to take, get a friend to ask him for you, or ask one of your crush's friends that you trust and are comfortable with.Again, make sure it isn't obvious that you're interested in your crush, or word could get out and you'll be embarrassed!Make sure you don't appear in every single class of your crush's. As tempting as the idea is, it'll freak him out and/or he'll become suspicious and perhaps withdrawn from you. Appear in at least three or more so that he'll notice you enough.  If he is the confident type, he'll enjoy talking about himself. Make sure to put in some information about yourself as well, but limit it so that you sound a little mysterious, leaving him wanting to know more about you.Don't blab out every bit of information about you, but give out just enough so that he has a basic knowledge of your personality and life.Let him do most of the talking, unless if he seems uncomfortable with it. If your crush is the shy type, you may have to do most of the steering in the conversation, and try not to intimidate him. Be gentle, and talk softly enough so that he is comfortable with the volume of your voice.Don't wait for your crush to start the conversation. At this point, you may have to start most of the conversations till you become a part of his daily life, and he'll begin to start the conversations when he recognizes you as that.If you keep silent, and wait for your crush to come up to you and start the conversation, the chances of that happening is extremely low, unless if he is very interested in you and possibly curious enough to try to find out about you.It's okay to be shy, but there is a limit to how shy you can get. Break out of your shell, or you'll never be able to make any progress in your relationship with your crush! Build your confidence, and tell yourself you can do it. If he is the right guy for you, you'll win him over. If he isn't, don't let him get to you, and simply move on with life.  Make random appearances here and there. If your crush or your crush's friend(s) question you, be ready with plausible excuses such as: ""The other tables were full"" or ""My friend was sitting here, so I came to sit here too"". Bring a trustworthy friend along to sit with you so that it doesn't seem awkward.If your crush sits at an all-guys table, it's probably best to keep to your own tables. Sit near enough so that he notices you, but not in your crush's table if this happens to be the case.Don't sit alone, or he'll think you're a loner and not be interested.Keep in mind that once you become good enough friends with your crush, your friendship with him can be the key to unlock the borders blocking you from his all-guys table. Just make sure to bring a friend along if you're uncomfortable about sitting with all-guys. Plus, it could look suspicious to the students if you're the only girl at your crush's table.Your crush may unexpectedly walk up to you, and invite you to sit with his table even if you two aren't close enough friends yet. Although this may be unlikely, it could happen, but don't wait for it to happen!

"Look at how the popular kid acts around your crush. Think of some qualities that you have that the popular kid doesn't have. Try being a little bit like the popular kid. Befriend them. Spend time with your crush. Text your crush. When you're ready, ask them out.",How to Get Your Crush to Choose You over a Popular Kid,"Do they seem to like your crush? Have you caught them looking at your crush often (even briefly)? How often have you seen the popular guy or girl talking to your crush? If they seem to like your crush, then you will have to work even harder, especially if your crush seems to be liking the popular kid back. , Are you shy but they're outgoing? You may see shyness as a disability, but shyness can have a cuteness to it that an outgoing personality just doesn't have. Embrace and bring out the cuter part of your shyness by blushing and doing other cute things that shy girls/boys usually do naturally. If it's vice versa, then be bold, strike up conversation and don't be afraid to lightly tease the guy/girl you like. Are you usually rebellious but the popular kid is usually more mild? Let the rebel in you show as rebel girls/guys can be hot and fun. Show them your wild side (appropriately mind you) by not being afraid to dance and have fun at parties and ignoring the popular kids if they try to insult you or, even better, coming up with a sassy, clever comeback to say to them. If it's vice versa, then try to show him the sweetness of a mild, more simple personality by doing nice little things for him like being there for him when he's upset and befriending him. Basically, use whatever qualities you have against the popular kid in your flirting.  This basically means trying to incorporate their personality into your personality. If you're a rebel and the other person is mild, try toning down your wild side and being a little less intimidating and reckless and looking before you leap. However, don't kill the rebel in you either and remember the last step! If the other person is more of a rebel than you, then try being a little more rebellious yourself by being less afraid of risking embarrassed and being able to laugh embarrassment off, taking a few risks (as long as they don't endanger your life and aren't too extreme), and standing up for yourself and others boldly. Just remember to still be mild and simple, yet interesting. If you're a shy guy/girl, try being a little more outgoing and making some small talk with your crush, even if it is sprinkled with shyness. You could also flirt a bit more boldly by catching their eye and winking, but then blushing and turning away shyly or teasing them lightly but then acting a little embarrassed and laughing a little to add some of your shy style to your flirting technique. If you're more of the outgoing, bold type, be a little bit shy as well. If you're an outgoing girl, try shyly playing with your hair, giggling, or biting your lip. If you're an outgoing guy, try looking away from them a little more quickly if they look at you and even laughing nervously sometimes. Just make sure that you still talk to your dream guy/girl often and stay bold.  Most of the time popular girls won't befriend their crushes (they'll just flirt) however, popular guys will usually befriend them so this method might not work as well for the guys. However, it can't hurt to be a friend to your crush either way. This can help your crush to feel closer to you and less intimidated by your attempts at flirting and/or breaking the touch barrier. This can also possibly make them more open to hugs and such.  This can usually be a point where you have an advantage over a popular kid because since they are so popular and they have a lot of attention, they don't have much time to just hang out with their love interest and are busy with other people as well. This doesn't call for being clingy and never leaving your crush alone, but it does call for being there for your crush when they need it and just spending time getting to know your crush. He/she will really appreciate it and it may make them think all the more about you. If you're worried that your crush will be uneasy with spending time with you, become their friend (see last step) or just ""happen"" to end up sitting with them in class or at lunch.  Don't do it non-stop or you'll appear creepy and it'll seem like you're stalking them. Just a simple ""hey. How's it going?"" and a smiley face will do.  Just say something like, ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" Then say, ""I was wondering if we could go out sometime."" If they don't answer, say something like, ""You can get back to me on it if you'd like, okay?"" If they decline the offer, say ""That's fine. Let's just keep being friends then, if that's alright.""

Decide if it is time to clean your saddle. Check with the manufacturer. Gather your supplies.,How to Clean an English Leather Saddle,"Put your saddle on a sawhorse, saddle rack, or something similar to hold it up while you clean it. This keeps your saddle stable and easy to adjust while you clean.Once your saddle is stable, remove any add-ons such as stirrups. These should be cleaned separately. , Getting loose dirt off before wetting your saddle makes the rest of the cleaning faster and easier. Use a dry cloth to remove any loose dirt and dust before wetting your saddle.Avoid grinding dirt into the saddle while dusting. Use a gentle hand to swipe over the surface of the saddle.Be sure to use a clean cloth or soft-bristled saddle brush with nothing on it.  Dip a double-sided kitchen sponge into a bucket of warm water. Gently wring it out and lather it up with saddle soap.Be sure the sponge is damp enough to create your lather, but not dripping wet. Excess water may cause the leather to dry slowly and could lead to warping or distortion.You can also use a loofah glove to apply and lather the saddle soap. Loofah gloves make cleaning stirrups and reins easier.  Place the soaped sponge on the saddle and rub vigorously in small circular motions. Cover the entire smooth leather surface of the saddle, including the underside and beneath flaps.Avoid suede, specialty leathers, or rough areas of the saddle.Rinse out your sponge and re-lather it with soap any time the sponge starts to dry or becomes too dirty.  Use a clean, damp sponge or a damp towel to wipe off any excess soap. Rinse the sponge or towel and repeat until all soap residue is gone .Pay close attention to folds and seams on your saddle. Use a toothbrush or cotton swab to remove soap residue from tight areas.  Use a dry towel to wipe away any excess water.

Allow the conditioner to absorb into the saddle for one hour.Use a purpose-made leather conditioning cream or neatsfoot oil to condition the saddle. Avoid products that are petroleum-based, as they could dry out the leather.Re-apply oil or cream to your towel as necessary to ensure even coverage. Uneven coverage may cause discoloration.

Make sure your saddle is getting cleaned regularly, but not so much that it dries out or damages the leather.If you ride daily, you may need to clean your saddle every two to three months.If you ride once a week or less, your saddle may only require cleaning twice a year.If you ride in environments where the saddle is frequently exposed to dirt, mud, salt, or sweat, you will want to clean your saddle whenever it gets noticeably dirty or starts to feel brittle.If you are about to store your saddle for a long stretch, such as a full season, clean and condition it before you store.  Every leather is a little different, and saddles differ from maker to maker.

You may convince it to turn around with a food reward instead, if the horse is trained and gentle. , Whenever you're near a horse, always move in calm, easy motions. Move your hands up slowly to take the rope, then coil it loosely in one hand.  Reach up to the horse's face and hold the halter at the bottom of the noseband, near the middle ring. Confirm that the halter is securely fastened.Never hook your finger through the halter, or the rings. If the horse pulls away abruptly, you could injure your hand.If the horse is not wearing a halter, skip down to the section below.  Let go of the halter and take up most of the slack in the rope, so the horse knows you've attached it. Avoid pulling hard or holding the rope too close to the horse, as this may cause an inexperienced horse to panic. A very skittish horse may even rear if you pull down or forward on the rope.A trained horse should yield to pressure on the lead rope, and move forward.A green horse may pull back.

"Groom your horse. Check your gear. Set the saddle pad on your horse. Grab the cinches, straps, and stirrups. Lift the saddle onto your horse. Lower the cinches and stirrups. Make the horse put his front hoof forward to avoid causing sores in the girth area on your horse where there are wrinkles in the horse's skin. Tighten the back cinch. Attach the breast collar (if you use one). Pull out any skin that may have gotten trapped under the cinches. Untie your horse. Remember to mount from your horse's left side.",How to Saddle a Horse Western,"Before you strap a saddle on your horse, it's important to ensure that your horse's hair is clean, and that he does not have any sores on his skin.Use a curry comb to detangle dirt, mud, and any other debris that might be matted in your horse's hair. Do not use the curry comb over any bony parts of the horse's body, as these may be more sensitive and could be injured by aggressive combing. Do not curry comb the neck and face. Use a stiff-bristled body brush, also called the dandy brush, to continue dislodging hard-to-remove debris and remove the debris you've already dislodged. You can use this brush on the neck, chest, and legs. Use a soft brush to gently flick away the debris removed by the curry comb and the body brush. Use this brush to do the face and legs.Finish things off by gently wiping down your horse's face and body with a clean grooming cloth. , Inspect the saddle and pad for any foreign objects that could cause irritation to your horse.  It's important to position the saddle pad properly, as this will be the barrier between your saddle and the horse's skin.Put the saddle pad on the withers (shoulders), slightly forward of where you want it to end up. The saddling process will inevitably drag the saddle pad back, so starting slightly forward should allow the saddle and pad to end up where you want them. Never slide the saddle pad forward on your horse's back for you will cause the hair to go against the grain and make it uncomfortable for the horse.  Lift the saddle in such a way that none of these attachments will get caught under the saddle.  If you have a hard time lifting the saddle, you may need to request assistance during this step.Stand next to your horse's left shoulder.Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, with your left foot near the horse's left hoof and your right foot slightly behind your left.Swing your torso and hoist the saddle up, so that your right arm ends up draped across the horse's back. This should land the saddle right on the saddle pad, on your horse's back.  Allow them to hang down across your horse.  Snug the front cinch (also called a girth). This should be done on your horse's left side, and should snug your saddle into place.  It's important to keep the back cinch tight, as this will keep the saddle from lifting up during riding. (Some saddles do not have a back cinch. Despite what the picture depicts, please assure that the girth is hooked on before you start with the other cinches), There are a number of different types of breast plate, and each one will require different assembly instructions.Ensure that the breast collar's center cinch strip is aligned with the center of your horse's stomach.Thread the latigo from the left side through the ring on the end of the cinch and D ring twice.Pull tightly, then thread the latigo around the back of the D ring to the left, around front then back through. The end should then come through the middle of the D ring, and thread down behind the loop made (like tying a tie), pulling tightly again.  One way of doing this is by gently bending your horse's front two legs at the knees, stretching out the belly and freeing any flesh that may have been caught in the cinches.  Be sure that your saddle is properly attached before you untie your horse.  Most horses are accustomed to being mounted from the left, and may become frightened if you attempt to mount from the right.

Bring the horse to a round corral. Let the horse investigate the rope. Soothe an agitated horse. Repeat the attachment many times. Try again with a short rope.,How to Put a Lead Rope on a Horse3,"If the horse is inexperienced or untrained, it's best to attach the lead rope in a round corral. This is an easy space to handle the horse where it still has some room to walk away.  If the horse is not used to ropes, let the animal sniff and investigate it first. It may help to rub the rope against your body, demonstrating that it is not harmful. Let the horse chew on the rope, and rub it gently against its nose. Praise the horse when it relaxes.If the horse doesn't calm down, raise your arms and calmly shoo it away. Once the horse calms down and starts chewing or dips its head, turn your body and invite it to approach. Repeat the exercise with the rope until the horse calms down.  If the horse presses its ears back or tries to back away, calmly stroke the horse and speak in gentle tones. Be gentle and patient until the horse relaxes and lets you put on the halter or clip on the rope. Always convince the horse to cooperate instead of forcing the halter on; you're never going to win a contest of strength with a horse.  If the horse is not fully relaxed after you've clipped on the rope, unhook it again and let the horse move away. Call it back to you, quickly snap the rope on again, and praise the horse if it stays calm. Repeat until the horse accepts the rope without pulling away.Do not chase after the horse in this situation. It's easier to develop trust if the horse comes to you.

Learn the best knots for tying up a horse ahead of time. Learn to tie a quick-release knot. Learn another quick-release knot. Learn to tie a bowline knot. Use caution when tying knots.,How to Tie up a Horse1,"The most common knots used to tie a horse are quick-release knots, of which there are several varieties, and the bowline knot. Quick-release knots are easy to tie, and while they will tighten up if the horse pulls against the rope, are still easy to release with a quick tug of the trailing rope.The bowline is a bit less convenient to tie and untie, but will not tighten up if the horse pulls on it. Also, some horses are quite adept at untying quick release knots. If you are going to leave your tied horse unsupervised or know that he has untied a quick release in the past, the bowline is the safer option. Practice tying these knots ahead of time, before you use them with an actual horse. , This quick-release knot should not tighten if your horse pulls against it, and is very easy to untie.First make a fold in the rope (called a ‘’bight’’) and fold it over the pole you are tying to, or through a ring.Then make another bight in the part of the rope that leads to the horse (called the “standing end”).Pull the second bight through the first bight.Then with your other hand, make a bight in the loose end of the rope, and pull this through the second bight.To tighten the knot, pull on the standing end.To release the knot, simply tug on the loose end.  This quick-release knot is easy to tie and untie, and can be finished off in a daisy-chain fashion to take up extra rope, and prevent your horse pulling or tripping on the loose end. First loop the rope over a pole, or through a ring.Then twist the loose end of the rope to form a loop.Hold the loop in your left hand, and with your right hand, wrap the loose end over the standing end.Fold the loose end over into a bight, and pull the bight through the loop in your left hand.Pull on the standing end to tighten the knot.Pull on the loose end to release the rope.To create an extra-secure knot that is harder for your horse to untie, create another bight in the loose end of the rope, and feed it through the last loop. Repeat this daisy-chain process as many times as needed to use up the loose end of the rope.  This is a secure knot that will not tighten if the horse pulls on it. You can untie it quickly, but your horse cannot.First take the standing end of the rope in your left hand and wrap the loose end over the pole.Then twist a loop in the standing end, and feed the loose end through the loop.Then wrap the loose end back over the standing end, and through the loop again going the other way.Pull firmly on both the loose and standing ends to snug the knot.  Never wrap a rope around your hand or finger, or put your hand inside or through any loop or bight while tying up a horse. If the horse were to jerk quickly, the loop could tighten on your hand and cause serious injury.

Tie your horse by its halter. Choose a safe place to secure your horse. Tie your horse up away from other horses. Secure the horse at eye-level or higher. Leave the right amount of slack. Shelter a horse that will be tied for a long time. Keep a knife handy for cutting rope in emergency situations. Use caution around tied horses. Untie the horse before removing its halter.,How to Tie up a Horse2,"You should only tie a horse up with a rope connected to a well-fitting halter. Tying a horse up by the bridle, either directly to the bit or to the reigns, can cause the horse pain and serious injury.  Only tie your horse to a solid object that the horse cannot break or pull over. Horses are very strong and can pull with tremendous strength when frightened. If you tie your horse to a fence or railing, inspect the poles or rails and be sure to choose one that is not damaged or corroded. Make sure the area in the immediate vicinity of the horse is clear of dangerous objects the horse might step on or run into.If you must tie your horse to something the horse ‘’could’’ break, tie a loop of string around the object and then tie the horse’s rope to the string, instead of the object itself. If the horse does decide to make a break for it, this will minimize property damage.  Make sure to tie your horse up far enough away from other horses that they cannot fight. It is best not to tie your horse up around other horses at all, until it is used to being tied.  Do not tie the horse to an object on or near the ground. The horse could step on the rope, trip on it, or get tangled up on it, and potentially suffer serious injury. You can tie a horse to something higher than his head.  Leave about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) of rope between the horse and the object it is tied to. This is enough rope to allow the horse to comfortably move his head. Leaving more rope can lead to injury.  If your horse will be tied up for a number of hours, be sure that there is food and water available, and that the horse is sheltered from the elements. Tying your horse to a sturdy fence post under the shade of a tree might be an option, or to a sturdy post or gate inside a barn.Check on the horse frequently, especially if it is new to being tied up.  It is always a good idea to carry a knife, in case the horse manages to pull the knot tight and you need to release it in a hurry. Cut through the rope between the post or ring and the knot. Be sure to hold the knife so the blade is facing away from both you and your horse, so that no one is injured if the rope abruptly gives way.  Never step over or under a tie rope, and remain well out of kicking range when walking behind the horse. Speak to your horse softly before approaching it, to avoid startling it, and keep your hands on the horse as you walk alongside it.  Untie the horse and turn the horse to where you want it to go before you remove the halter. Quick-release knots should be very easy to untie. For the bowline, simply untie the knot using both hands.","['You should only tie a horse up with a rope connected to a well-fitting halter.', 'Tying a horse up by the bridle, either directly to the bit or to the reigns, can cause the horse pain and serious injury.', 'Only tie your horse to a solid object that the horse cannot break or pull over.', 'Horses are very strong and can pull with tremendous strength when frightened.', 'If you tie your horse to a fence or railing, inspect the poles or rails and be sure to choose one that is not damaged or corroded.', 'Make sure the area in the immediate vicinity of the horse is clear of dangerous objects the horse might step on or run into.', 'If you must tie your horse to something the horse ‘’could’’ break, tie a loop of string around the object and then tie the horse’s rope to the string, instead of the object itself.', 'If the horse does decide to make a break for it, this will minimize property damage.', 'Make sure to tie your horse up far enough away from other horses that they cannot fight.', 'It is best not to tie your horse up around other horses at all, until it is used to being tied.', 'Do not tie the horse to an object on or near the ground.', 'The horse could step on the rope, trip on it, or get tangled up on it, and potentially suffer serious injury.', 'You can tie a horse to something higher than his head.', 'Leave about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9\xa0m) of rope between the horse and the object it is tied to.', 'This is enough rope to allow the horse to comfortably move his head.', 'Leaving more rope can lead to injury.', 'If your horse will be tied up for a number of hours, be sure that there is food and water available, and that the horse is sheltered from the elements.', 'Tying your horse to a sturdy fence post under the shade of a tree might be an option, or to a sturdy post or gate inside a barn.', 'Check on the horse frequently, especially if it is new to being tied up.', 'It is always a good idea to carry a knife, in case the horse manages to pull the knot tight and you need to release it in a hurry.', 'Cut through the rope between the post or ring and the knot.', 'Be sure to hold the knife so the blade is facing away from both you and your horse, so that no one is injured if the rope abruptly gives way.', 'Never step over or under a tie rope, and remain well out of kicking range when walking behind the horse.', 'Speak to your horse softly before approaching it, to avoid startling it, and keep your hands on the horse as you walk alongside it.', 'Untie the horse and turn the horse to where you want it to go before you remove the halter.', 'Quick-release knots should be very easy to untie.', 'For the bowline, simply untie the knot using both hands.']"

In addition, guinea pigs can get lost in the shuffle or be scared by loud noises.Consider picking a single room that doesn't have too many places for the guinea pig to hide.A hallway or bathroom works well. Places like the kitchen have too many places for the guinea pigs to hide or squeeze into.Also remember that guinea pigs like to chew. If you love the furniture in a particular room, you may not want to put your guinea pigs in there.Another option is to use a wire pen or cage that you set up in a room.  Guinea pigs are happy to chew on electrical cords if you give them the chance. Make sure any cords are up out of reach of the guinea pigs or that you pick a room that doesn't have them near the floor.  Move any plants and other hazards out of reach. Plastic bags, for instance, can pose a suffocation hazard. Make sure to also pick up any dead leaves, as many houseplants are poisonous to guinea pigs.  If you have larger animals in your home, they should not be in the same room as the guinea pigs when they are out. They could attack or injure the guinea pigs by just following their instincts.  That way, they won't rush into the room without checking to see where the guinea pigs are. In addition, if guinea pigs are underfoot without the family's knowledge, they could easily be stepped on.You could use a note or sign on the door to help family members remember.This step also warns your family not to let other pets in.

You can use a wire fence or cage, as long as it doesn't leave gaps that your guinea pigs can escape through.  Guinea pigs can stand too much heat, so make sure you keep them cool when they go outside. For one, you should always provide them with shade, so they can cool down. In addition, only let them out during cooler times of the day in the summer.Guinea pigs prefer temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. While they can stand a bit more variation, you don't want to go too much colder or warmer.  Damp grass can give your pig a chill, and that's not good for them. Also, make sure you aren't setting them down on grass that has been sprayed with insecticides or other chemicals, as that can be damaging for your guinea pig.

Signs of heatstroke include lethargy, a limp body, trouble breathing, a rapid pulse, and a wet chin. Your guinea pig may also feel hot to the touch. Check the ears to see if they feel extra warm.If you notice signs of heatstroke, bring the guinea pig indoors. Use tepid water (not cold because it can cause shock) to dab around the ears and feet. You can even dip its feet in water.

The larger the cage is, the better off your guinea pig will be. At a minimum, each guinea pig should have 7.5 square feet of cage.That's a cage that's approximately 3 by 2.5 feet.If you can, go for a bigger cage, so your guinea pig will need less exercise outside of its cage.  You can buy a cage for a guinea pig. However, most cages that are labelled for guinea pigs are not big enough. You can find ones meant for other animals, though, that will work for guinea pigs. Pick one that has metal bars on the side, not wood, as guinea pigs can't chew through metal.Also, make sure it has a solid floor. Guinea pigs' feet are easily damaged by floors that are made of wire, so it needs to be solid to protect your guinea pig.Go for a larger floor space rather than one that has many levels. Floor space is more important.  Another option is making your own. You can make your own cages out of wire fences on the floor with other materials underneath. One option is to use corrugated correx or corrugated coroplast, available from sign making shops.Start with cube grids. Cube grids can be reconfigured to any size to make an outward ""cage.""Cut the correx or coroplast to fit. You can use the material as a floor, then use more of it to create a border around the floor. Tape it together from the outside. Add newspapers and hay for your guinea pig to complete the cage.","['A large cage is important because it gives your guinea pig a large area to explore.', 'The larger the cage is, the better off your guinea pig will be.', 'At a minimum, each guinea pig should have 7.5 square feet of cage.', ""That's a cage that's approximately 3 by 2.5 feet."", 'If you can, go for a bigger cage, so your guinea pig will need less exercise outside of its cage.', 'You can buy a cage for a guinea pig.', 'However, most cages that are labelled for guinea pigs are not big enough.', 'You can find ones meant for other animals, though, that will work for guinea pigs.', ""Pick one that has metal bars on the side, not wood, as guinea pigs can't chew through metal."", 'Also, make sure it has a solid floor.', ""Guinea pigs' feet are easily damaged by floors that are made of wire, so it needs to be solid to protect your guinea pig."", 'Go for a larger floor space rather than one that has many levels.', 'Floor space is more important.', 'Another option is making your own.', 'You can make your own cages out of wire fences on the floor with other materials underneath.', 'One option is to use corrugated correx or corrugated coroplast, available from sign making shops.', 'Start with cube grids.', 'Cube grids can be reconfigured to any size to make an outward ""cage.', '""Cut the correx or coroplast to fit.', 'You can use the material as a floor, then use more of it to create a border around the floor.', 'Tape it together from the outside.', 'Add newspapers and hay for your guinea pig to complete the cage.']"
Train her to come to you when she is called. Practice the stand up command. Do the turn in a circle command. Train your guinea pig to push a ball. Teach her to jump through a hoop. Practice litter box training.,How to Train Your Guinea Pig,"Like most pets, guinea pigs can learn to come to you when called with a little practice and motivation in the form a treat. Make sure you use your guinea pig’s name often and address her by name when you feed her and give her treats.You can also practice getting her to come to you when called by taking her out of her cage and placing her a few feet away from you. Call her by name and hold out one of her favorite treats.Your guinea pig should be motivated to run to you. When she does so, give her a treat as a reward. Practice this at least once a day and over time she should come to you when called by name outside her cage and inside her cage. , This is another simple command you can teach your guinea pig using a treat.Hold a treat above your guinea pig’s head so she has to stand on her back legs to get to it. Say the command “Stand up” and then let her have the treat once she is on her back legs.Repeat this command once a day on a consistent basis. Over time, your guinea pig will stand up when you command her, even when you are not holding a treat.  You can practice this command with your guinea pig when she is in her cage or outside of her cage.Hold a treat in your hand and let your guinea pig approach you. When she is in front of you, move your hand so you make a circle, and say the command “Circle”.Your guinea pig should follow the motion of your hand, with the treat, and make a circle. Once she makes a circle, give her the treat. Repeat this once a day until she can circle on command, without the treat.  Use a ball that is not too heavy and not too big, like a tennis ball, so your guinea pig can maneuver it easily. You will also need a treat that is long and flat, like a carrot stick.Place the carrot stick on the ground and then put the tennis ball on top of the carrot stick.Encourage your guinea pig to try to push the ball off the treat so she can access the treat and say “Push the ball.”Repeat these steps and over time you should be able to remove the treat so she learns to push the ball on her own, without the treat.  You will need a hoop that is about 6” - 10” in diameter, or you can use pipe cleaners to form a hoop that is close to that size. The top of an ice cream tub, or a tennis racket without the strings would also work. Make sure that whatever you use as a hoop, there are no sharp edges or anything your guinea pig can get stuck on as she learns to jump.Begin by holding the hoop so it touches the ground or the bottom of your guinea pig’s cage. Hold a treat on one side of the hoop, or have someone help you by holding the treat as you hold the hoop.Call your guinea pig’s name and make sure she can see the treat on the other side of the hoop. Say the command: “Through the hoop”. You may need to give your guinea pig a nudge or a gentle push to convince her to jump through the hoop. Over time, she will be motivated enough by the treat to jump through the hoop and get it.Praise her and give her the treat when she goes through the hoop. Repeat these steps until your guinea pig starts to go through the hoop on her own, without the motivation of the treat.  Many guinea pig owners teach their pets to go to the bathroom in a litter box. However, this takes a lot of patience and practice. When you are first litter box training your guinea pig, be prepared for some accidents and do not scold or punish your guinea pig if this happens. Your guinea pig will respond more to positive reinforcement and acknowledgement.To litter train your guinea pig, place a litter box in the spot in her cage where she goes to the bathroom often. Place a handful of hay in the box and a few fecal pellets.When you notice your guinea pig using the litter box, give her a treat as praise. Over time, she will understand that using the litter box is a good thing that leads to treats and she will start to use it on a regular basis.","['Like most pets, guinea pigs can learn to come to you when called with a little practice and motivation in the form a treat.', 'Make sure you use your guinea pig’s name often and address her by name when you feed her and give her treats.', 'You can also practice getting her to come to you when called by taking her out of her cage and placing her a few feet away from you.', 'Call her by name and hold out one of her favorite treats.', 'Your guinea pig should be motivated to run to you.', 'When she does so, give her a treat as a reward.', 'Practice this at least once a day and over time she should come to you when called by name outside her cage and inside her cage.', ', This is another simple command you can teach your guinea pig using a treat.', 'Hold a treat above your guinea pig’s head so she has to stand on her back legs to get to it.', 'Say the command “Stand up” and then let her have the treat once she is on her back legs.', 'Repeat this command once a day on a consistent basis.', 'Over time, your guinea pig will stand up when you command her, even when you are not holding a treat.', 'You can practice this command with your guinea pig when she is in her cage or outside of her cage.', 'Hold a treat in your hand and let your guinea pig approach you.', 'When she is in front of you, move your hand so you make a circle, and say the command “Circle”.', 'Your guinea pig should follow the motion of your hand, with the treat, and make a circle.', 'Once she makes a circle, give her the treat.', 'Repeat this once a day until she can circle on command, without the treat.', 'Use a ball that is not too heavy and not too big, like a tennis ball, so your guinea pig can maneuver it easily.', 'You will also need a treat that is long and flat, like a carrot stick.', 'Place the carrot stick on the ground and then put the tennis ball on top of the carrot stick.', 'Encourage your guinea pig to try to push the ball off the treat so she can access the treat and say “Push the ball.', '”Repeat these steps and over time you should be able to remove the treat so she learns to push the ball on her own, without the treat.', 'You will need a hoop that is about 6” - 10” in diameter, or you can use pipe cleaners to form a hoop that is close to that size.', 'The top of an ice cream tub, or a tennis racket without the strings would also work.', 'Make sure that whatever you use as a hoop, there are no sharp edges or anything your guinea pig can get stuck on as she learns to jump.', 'Begin by holding the hoop so it touches the ground or the bottom of your guinea pig’s cage.', 'Hold a treat on one side of the hoop, or have someone help you by holding the treat as you hold the hoop.', 'Call your guinea pig’s name and make sure she can see the treat on the other side of the hoop.', 'Say the command: “Through the hoop”.', 'You may need to give your guinea pig a nudge or a gentle push to convince her to jump through the hoop.', 'Over time, she will be motivated enough by the treat to jump through the hoop and get it.', 'Praise her and give her the treat when she goes through the hoop.', 'Repeat these steps until your guinea pig starts to go through the hoop on her own, without the motivation of the treat.', 'Many guinea pig owners teach their pets to go to the bathroom in a litter box.', 'However, this takes a lot of patience and practice.', 'When you are first litter box training your guinea pig, be prepared for some accidents and do not scold or punish your guinea pig if this happens.', 'Your guinea pig will respond more to positive reinforcement and acknowledgement.', 'To litter train your guinea pig, place a litter box in the spot in her cage where she goes to the bathroom often.', 'Place a handful of hay in the box and a few fecal pellets.', 'When you notice your guinea pig using the litter box, give her a treat as praise.', 'Over time, she will understand that using the litter box is a good thing that leads to treats and she will start to use it on a regular basis.']"
Observe your guinea pig. Buy a litter tray. Prepare the litter tray. Watch her behavior. Keep up the litter tray. Be patient. Start small. Lay out her litter tray. Cover up the remaining corners. Expand the area.,How to Potty Train a Guinea Pig,"Before you put a litter box in your guinea pig's cage, you need to watch her to see where she normally goes to the bathroom. Guinea pigs like to scent mark their territory, so your guinea pig will likely scope out a corner of her cage to pee and poop in regularly.Although there is one corner where she will go most often, this does not mean she will always go in this corner. Just pick the place she frequents the most. , Once you have figured out the best location for your guinea pig's litter box, you need to buy a tray that will fit nicely in that corner. Pick one that is the right size for the cage as well as one that will be comfortable for your guinea pig. You don't want it to be too small because then she won't have enough room to sit and go to the potty.You can buy small litter trays at your local pet store that are for small rodents.You also need to put in brand new bedding. Otherwise, she will smell her old pee and might want to go there.  The litter tray needs to be filled with the same kind of bedding that you keep in your guinea pig cage. Although it is called a litter tray, the substance used for the tray is not what is typically considered litter but is actually just the same hay or straw that you keep in your guinea pig cage. You should take a handful or two from the cage where she has already pooped and peed and lay that in the litter tray at first. Then you should set the try in the cage that you picked earlier.Using hay at first that has already been soiled will lead her to the tray because her scent will be all over it.The kinds of bedding that work great for guinea pigs are aspen, wood pulp, hay, and straw. There are also different varieties of litter pellets and bedding that have been vet recommended as well. Never buy cedar or corn cob for your guinea pig because they are toxic.Don't put her food and water near or in the litter box. She will not like to potty where she eats.You can also put a little bit of eating straw in her litter tray as well so she will feel comfortable in there and might be able to munch a little while she goes to the bathroom.  Once you place the try in her cage, watch to see if she uses it. Since it smells like her and is in a familiar location, she should use it most of the time. If you find that she doesn't use it, you might have to take it out and try again. There might be something wrong with the tray that is deterring her from using it.When you see her using her litter box, give her a treat. This will encourage her behavior and make her want to use it more so you will give her more treats.If the sides on the litter tray look too big for her, you should use sharp scissors or a small saw or knife and cut the excess edge off. This will make it short enough for her to get into the tray.  You should only clean out the litter tray every three days or so. You can dump out what is in the litter tray and replenish it with new litter. You should only wash the tray every other week. This will make sure that her smell will remain on the tray and she will likely go back to it.You should use litter that is best for guinea pigs. If you aren't sure what to use, ask at your local pet store or vet's office.  Although most guinea pigs will learn to use a litter tray most or all of the time, there are some guinea pigs that might never learn to use it. Keep trying to get your guinea pig to use the tray, but even if she only uses it half the time, that is that much less you have to clean up out of her cage.Never punish your guinea pig or yell at her. She doesn't understand why she needs to go to the potty in the same place all the time. Encourage the good behavior, but don't try punishment. It doesn't work on guinea pigs.  Once you have trained your guinea pig in her cage, you may want to train your guinea pig outside of her cage during play time. Start somewhere small. It needs to be an area that you can control easily and where you can keep an eye on her. You should make sure there aren't any small vents that she can run into without getting out.A bathroom or hallway is a great place to start. They are small, have few wires that are close to the ground, and have very few places for your guinea pig to hide. This will help keep her safe and help you keep track of her while still allowing her to exercise.  You need to pick a dark, out of the way corner of the room to place her litter tray. This will encourage her to seek that corner out and use it to potty. Since this will be the only thing that has her smell on it, she will be able to find it, not matter which corner you put it in.Try to leave some litter in it that has already been used. This way it will feel like her territory.If you want, you can let her loose for a little while first to see which corner she prefers to go to the potty and then place her litter tray there.  Guinea pigs like to use the potty in dark corners away from other things, just like they do in their cages. To help persuade your guinea pig to use the corner where you placed her tray, you need cover up the remaining corners so she cannot run there to potty.If she has no other dark corner to pee or poop in, she will be more likely to use her litter tray in the other corner.If you want to, you can also place newspaper around the room in case she has an accident. This will make it easier to clean up.  Once your guinea pig gets used to the area, you can expand it a little at a time. Since she should already know where her litter tray is, she should use it even though her play area is bigger. Just make sure you keep wires off the floor and hard to reach hiding spaces covered so you don't injure or lose your guinea pig.Just like with training in the cage, do not scold her if she uses the bathroom somewhere else. You can reward her when she goes in her litter tray, which will be a positive reminder to use the area.","[""Before you put a litter box in your guinea pig's cage, you need to watch her to see where

"Observe where your guinea pig tends to eliminate. Set up a litter box. Choose a quality litter. Place multiple litter boxes in the cage, if necessary.

Accept your guinea pig may not always use its litter box.",How to Litter Train Guinea Pigs,"The first step to litter training is watching your guinea pig. Most guinea pigs have a certain area of their cage where they eliminate. If you set up a guinea pig's litter box in this space, it's more likely to use the box.Watch your guinea pig for a few days. Take note of where it tends to eliminate.You can also pay attention when you're cleaning the cage. You may notice a lot of droppings and urine in one area of the cage. , You can buy a litter box online or make one yourself. Make sure the litter box is easy for your guinea pig to get in and out of. Place it in the corner of the cage where your guinea pig usually eliminates.Make sure the box you choose is large enough that the guinea pig can fit its entire body in the box.Make sure the sides are low enough. The guinea pig should be able to climb in and out of the box with ease.  Go for organic paper-based litters. Wood litters can sometimes cause respiratory problems. You can find guinea pig litter online or purchase some at a local pet store.If you can't find a litter box that works for you, you can always place litter in the corner of the box.  Some guinea pigs have more than one corner where they eliminate. If this is the case, they are less likely to start using a single litter box. If your guinea pig eliminates in more than one corner, set up a box in each corner the guinea pig tends to use.  For the most part, litter training is fairly hands off. Some guinea pigs will take to the litter box and others will not. When starting out, try to see if the guinea pig approaches the litter box on its own.Many guinea pigs will realize they're supposed to eliminate in the box. With luck, your guinea pig will take to its litter box right away.  If your guinea pig is unsure of the box, place a small amount of hay in the box.

If it smells any lingering feces or urine, it may then realize its supposed to eliminate in the box.Some people advocate leaving food in the box. The guinea pig will eat and then eliminate. This method is only likely to work if you've seen your guinea pig defecate or urinate near its litter box before. Many guinea pigs will not eliminate near a food source to avoid contamination.  If your guinea pig starts using its box, change the litter regularly. Try to change it about every three days. A guinea pig will not eliminate in a dirty litter box.Only wash the box every other week. You want some of the scent to remain intact so the guinea pig knows to use its litter box.  Clumping cat litter can be dangerous for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs may eat clumping cat litter, and can choke on it. Clumping cat litter also contains chemicals meant to reduce scent, which can be toxic to a guinea pig.It may be a good idea to ask your vet about safe litters before choosing a litter for your guinea pig.  Never scold a guinea pig for failing to use its litter box. Your guinea pig is unlikely to understand why it is being scolded. Scolding will not encourage your guinea pig to use its litter box. It will only create stress.You should also avoid other forms of punishment, especially physical punishment. You should never hit your pet.  Not all guinea pigs take to a litter box. As guinea pigs are less domesticated than other household pets, they're difficult to train. Despite your best efforts, a guinea pig may never learn to use its litter box.

Guinea pigs hide sickness very well, that's how guinea pigs defend themselves in the wild because the predators can sense when a guinea pig is vulnerable.Don't forget to take care of your guinea pig's hygiene.You might need extra services like grooming, nail clipping, or other special procedures, like neutering. If this is your first vet visit, your guinea pig's veterinarian should tell you during your first visit if there needs to be extra services involved.Never cut your guinea pig's nails on your own. Guinea pigs and other animals have a vein called a ""quick"" which if cut, can cause extreme pain and bleeding. So always have a licensed vet cut your guinea pig's nails.  For example, if your guinea pig is in a hut, stick your finger close to the hut. A healthy guinea pig that trusts you will investigate by sniffing your finger for a couple of seconds before quickly returning to the hut.  Guinea pigs don't want to be trapped in a cage all day! Remove all wires, plants, and other objects a guinea pig shouldn't have access to. Make sure the area is clean, and has plenty of fresh air flow (not cold air!). Cover the spot where your guinea is laying in with a fleece (avoid using an overly fluffy blanket) blanket or a towel. Fence the area in with a gate. Don't forget to throw in some of your guinea pig's favorite toys! Your guinea pig will be have plenty of space to exercise and play in, and it might show its appreciation by popcorning or oinking!Don't forget to get supervise your guinea pig!, This might sound like it won't work, but giving a guinea pig fresh food is actually another great way to get your guinea pig to popcorn! Guinea pigs are huge food fans, just like us humans. They will sometimes squeak when they hear a cabinet or a refrigerator opening! Make sure you supply your guinea pig with fresh hay everyday.Don't overfeed your guinea pig. Obesity is a common problem, and can cause many problems for guinea pigs. A quick test to see if your guinea pig is underweight is to run your hands down its body, if you can feel its ribs easily its underweight. If you just feel fat and no ribs, your guinea pig is overweight.  Don't feel bad if you never see your guinea pig popcorn. Guinea pigs have other ways of letting you know they love you, such as oinking and purring.If your guinea pig is older, it is less likely to popcorn. Popcorning is mostly seen in younger guinea pigs.There may be plenty of other reasons your guinea pig isn't popcorning, but if you are really concerned, talk to a guinea pig behavioral specialist or visit the vet.","['If you\xa0recently adopted your guinea pig, you must give it time to settle into its new home.', ""This is a long process, and can't just be done overnight."", 'If your guinea pig is in a rowdy environment, or if you\xa0negatively interact (scream, hurting it etc.) with your guinea pig, it can be very\xa0difficult to get their trust again.', 'Guinea pigs are easy pets to take care of, but they can also be very stubborn!,', ""A sick guinea pig isn't a happy guinea pig!"", ""Always take your guinea pig to the vet, even if you don't suspect it's sick."", 'Regular vet checks are always a good idea.', ""Take your guinea pig to the vet\xa0immediately if your guinea pig has a hunched poster, crusty eyes, patchy hair loss or overall just looks like it's in pain."", ""Guinea pigs hide sickness very well, that's how guinea pigs defend themselves in the wild because the predators can sense when a guinea pig is\xa0vulnerable."", ""Don't forget to take care of your guinea pig's hygiene."", 'You might need extra services like grooming, nail clipping, or other special procedures, like\xa0neutering.', ""If this is your first vet visit, your guinea pig's veterinarian should tell you during your first visit if there needs to be extra services involved."", ""Never cut your guinea pig's nails on your own."", 'Guinea pigs and other animals have a vein called a ""quick"" which if cut, can cause extreme pain and bleeding.', ""So always have a\xa0licensed vet cut your guinea pig's nails."", 'For example, if your guinea pig is in a hut, stick your finger close to the hut.', 'A healthy guinea pig that trusts you will investigate by sniffing your finger for a couple of seconds before quickly returning to the hut.', ""Guinea pigs don't want to be trapped in a cage all day!"", ""Remove all wires, plants, and other objects a guinea pig shouldn't have\xa0access to."", 'Make sure the area is clean, and has plenty of fresh air flow (not cold air!).', 'Cover the spot where your guinea is laying in with a fleece (avoid using an overly fluffy blanket) blanket or a towel.', 'Fence the area in with a gate.', ""Don't forget to throw in some of your guinea pig's favorite toys!"", ""Your guinea pig will be have plenty of space to exercise and play in, and it might show its appreciation by popcorning or oinking!Don't forget to get supervise your guinea pig!,"", ""This might sound like it won't work, but giving a guinea pig fresh food is actually another great way to get your guinea pig to popcorn!"", 'Guinea pigs are huge food fans, just like us humans.', 'They will sometimes squeak when they hear a cabinet or a\xa0refrigerator opening!', 'Make sure you supply your guinea pig with fresh hay everyday.', ""Don't overfeed your guinea pig."", 'Obesity is a common problem, and can cause many problems for guinea pigs.', 'A quick test to see if your guinea pig is underweight is to run your hands down its body, if you can feel its ribs easily its underweight.', 'If you just feel fat and no ribs, your guinea pig is overweight.', ""Don't feel bad if you never see your guinea pig popcorn."", 'Guinea pigs have other ways of letting you know they love you, such as oinking and purring.', 'If your guinea pig is older, it is less likely to popcorn.', 'Popcorning is mostly seen in younger guinea pigs.', ""There may be plenty of other reasons your guinea pig isn't popcorning, but if you are really concerned, talk to a guinea pig behavioral specialist or visit the vet.""]"
"Put a saddle blanket or pad on your horse's back. Position the saddle on the blanket. Position the stirrup, cinches, and straps on the left side of the horse.",How to Tighten Your Horse's Western Girth1,"The saddle blanket protects the horse's body from friction from the leather saddle, and is vital for a safe ride. It also keeps the saddle clean from the horse's body which will sweat and froth with the exertion of a ride.If you don’t have a blanket, you need one to properly tack your horse.You can get a saddle blanket at any farming supply or agriculture store. You can choose a traditional woven blanket which is folded in half for use, or you can buy a felt or cotton pad which is less likely to bunch under the saddle or catch burrs if you ride in a field.Be sure you brush the horse and ensure there are no burrs in its coat or any injuries to its skin.Position the blanket slightly over the horse's withers (the ridge between its shoulder blades). First put the blanket down a bit too far toward the neck, then pull it back toward the horse's tail until it's in the correct position. This method smooths the hair under the blanket so that it lies flat and doesn't itch or bother the animal. , This process might seem cumbersome and can take some practice before it becomes easy, especially if you're used to the English saddle which has less straps and other things dangling down.Stand next to the horse's left shoulder and keep your feet shoulder-width apart. Hook the right stirrup up over the saddle horn so that it won't get caught under the saddle as you lift it, then swing the saddle up and over the horse's back so that your right arm is across the horse's back.Be sure to practice good lifting techniques to avoid injury to your back or leg muscles; saddles can weigh from 10-35 pounds and swinging it without proper posture could injure your muscles or joints.As you put the saddle over the blanket, be sure that you grab the stirrups (the leather loops for the rider's feet), cinches, and straps (any leather hanging down) and hold them out of the way so that they don't get stuck under the saddle.The process of getting the saddle and blanket in the right place might cause them both to slide too far back; in that case, start over with the blanket first.

Attach the girth. Cinch the ties. Put the finishing touches on.,How to Tighten Your Horse's Western Girth2,"Most saddles have a removable leather strap called a girth or latigo that attaches with buckles to the tie on the horse's right side (some have a girth attached to the tie, in which case you can skip this step).Buckle the girth securely to the tie that hangs down by the horse's front leg on the right side of the horse.Walk in front of the horse back to its left side, and then reach under the horse's body and pass the girth underneath the horse's chest.  The girth should be pulled up to the buckle on the left side of the horse's saddle, where it should be fastened much like the other side using a buckle.Cinch it tightly but gently (don't force it to go tighter than feels snug and secure). You should wait until the horse exhales to cinch it, because if you tighten it while the horse has its lungs full of air it will be too loose when the horse exhales to be safe.Some horses intentionally take a deep breath right before you tighten the girth. When they do that they get bigger around, so when they breathe out the girth is too loose - just the way they like it! This is called bloating, and some horses do it because a girth doesn't fit them or their skin is being pinched under the girth. If your horse does this, you might want to check that the girth itself is long enough for your horse and not causing irritation or pain.You can secure the additional length of the tie by passing it through the D-ring at the top of the tie, wrapping it around the tie and pulling it through at the top (like a men's necktie). This will keep it up and out of the way of the horse's legs even if the horse runs.  Before you mount up, be sure you didn't forget anything.Be sure the stirrups are down on either side.Double-check that everything is tight because if it's loose and you get on you'll slide right off!Be sure that the bridle is on correctly.Now mount up and ride!

Watch out for a shifting saddle. Notice if your saddle seems to bounce up and down. Dismount and inspect the cinch. Tighten the cinch before mounting.,How to Tighten Your Horse's Western Girth3,"If you feel that you are having to lean to one side to keep your balance or keep upright, it's probably because the saddle was either placed on incorrectly or has shifted because it is loose. You can know for sure by looking at the pommel (the horn that you hold with one hand while riding). If the horn (or pommel, the knob that sticks up on the saddle for the rider to hold) is not in perfect alignment with the horse's mane, the saddle has shifted off-center.The saddle may have shifted because it was too loose, or it may have shifted because you are putting too much weight on one stirrup and not evenly distributing your weight (this happens all the time, especially to new riders, and especially if you're riding the horse in circles). You can try to shift the saddle back by putting your weight on the opposite side stirrup, but if the saddle moves too easily it is probably too loose.Dismount and adjust it.  While you might do a lot of bouncing out of the saddle if your horse is trotting or cantering, the saddle itself should never leave the horse's back. If it's moving up and down as the horse moves, it will injure the horse's back.If the saddle itself seems to leave the horse's body as you trot, you must immediately dismount and tighten the girth.  If you're not sure if the saddle is on properly, don't keep riding, even if you're worried that others will think you don't know what you're doing. Every rider has to adjust the saddle sometimes, and no one will think less of you for putting your horse's comfort and your own safety first.If someone is with you, they can inspect the cinch for you. This is more reliable than doing it yourself since your weight in the saddle will cause more ""give"" to the girth and make it looser. Have the person check to see if they can pull the girth itself an inch or more away from the horse's body while you are in the saddle. If they can, it's too loose.  You most likely will not have to repeat all the steps again, but you will need to loosen the tie and unbuckle the girth from the horse's left side to re-tighten.Make a note of what position the buckle is in before you remove it, and then ensure that you tighten it to the next notch (or two, if the saddle was very loose) as you re-cinch it.","[""If you feel that you are having to lean to one side to keep your balance or keep upright, it's probably because the saddle was either placed on incorrectly or has shifted because it is loose."", 'You can know for sure by looking at the pommel (the horn that you hold with one hand while riding).', ""If the horn (or pommel, the knob that sticks up on the saddle for the rider to hold) is not in perfect alignment with the horse's mane, the saddle has shifted off-center."", ""The saddle may have shifted because it was too loose, or it may have shifted because you are putting too much weight on one stirrup and not evenly distributing your weight (this happens all the time, especially to new riders, and especially if you're riding the horse in circles)."", 'You can try to shift the saddle back by putting your weight on the opposite side stirrup, but if the saddle moves too easily it is probably too loose.', 'Dismount and adjust it.', ""While you might do a lot of bouncing out of the saddle if your horse is trotting or cantering, the saddle itself should never leave the horse's back."", ""If it's moving up and down as the horse moves, it will injure the horse's back."", ""If the saddle itself seems to leave the horse's body as you trot, you must immediately dismount and tighten the girth."", ""If you're not sure if the saddle is on properly, don't keep riding, even if you're worried that others will think you don't know what you're doing."", ""Every rider has to adjust the saddle sometimes, and no one will think less of you for putting your horse's comfort and your own safety first."", 'If someone is with you, they can inspect the cinch for you.', 'This is more reliable than doing it yourself since your weight in the saddle will cause more ""give"" to the girth and make it looser.', ""Have the person check to see if they can pull the girth itself an inch or more away from the horse's body while you are in the saddle."", ""If they can, it's too loose."", ""You most likely will not have to repeat all the steps again, but you will need to loosen the tie and unbuckle the girth from the horse's left side to re-tighten."", 'Make a note of what position the buckle is in before you remove it, and then ensure that you tighten it to the next notch (or two, if the saddle was very loose) as you re-cinch it.']"
Build a trustworthy bond with your piggy. Research different training methods. Choose the training method that works best for you and your guinea pig. Gather the materials that you will need for training.,How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks1,"Having a stable relationship with an animal makes them so much easier to train. If your guinea pig doesn't trust you, or thinks of you as a scary giant that comes to try and communicate all of the time, it will be more difficult to teach. The trust of an animal is a very fragile thing.Think of it as if you are a mountain climber, trying to climb the mountain of training. The peak is success, and the rope that you depend on to get you to the top is the relationship with the animal you wish to train. Would you rather have a weak rope - aka a weak relationship - or a stronger, more dependable one? If you choose the weak rope, and it snaps, you'll come tumbling back down to where you started. The strong rope has a better chance of holding up, though, be aware that if you are constantly tampering with the rope, even the strongest has a chance of breaking.If you aren't sure of your current relationship with your pet, it is best to keep working with them until they trust you enough to allow you to pick them up and pet them. This may take longer with skittish piggies, but never give up. , Once your piggy is willing to trust you and do what you say, it's time to start looking into the many methods of training. Guinea pigs are very fragile, and their brains work a bit differently from a dog's, so every training method will need to be tweaked before use with a guinea pig.Clicker training and verbal markers are a few ways to train your guinea pig. Clicker training is slightly easier than using a verbal marker, and requires a clicker, while using a verbal marker is more difficult and can have different results than what is expected.  Some owners have different needs than others, and some animals need a specific type of training. As mentioned before, any training method chosen will need to be tweaked in many different ways to suit a guinea pig rather than a dog.  Different methods require different materials. Some may need to be purchased, while others can just be found around the house. Training a guinea pig is not as expensive as training a dog, per se, but cost is made up in effort.If you choose to clicker train your guinea pig, you will need a soft clicker-be sure that it is not too loud or sharp for a guinea pig's ears-and, of course, treats.Treats that have worked well for many guinea pig owners include chopped up carrots, celery (with veins removed), and lettuce torn up into little pieces. Whatever the reward may be, always make sure that it is quick, chewable, and guinea pig-safe.","['Having a stable relationship with an animal makes them so much easier to train.', ""If your guinea pig doesn't trust you, or thinks of you as a scary giant that comes to try and communicate all of the time, it will be more difficult to teach."", 'The trust of an animal is a very fragile thing.', 'Think of it as if you are a mountain climber, trying to climb the mountain of training.', 'The peak is success, and the rope that you depend on to get you to the top is the relationship with the animal you wish to train.', 'Would you rather have a weak rope - aka a weak relationship - or a stronger, more dependable one?', ""If you choose the weak rope, and it snaps, you'll come tumbling back down to where you started."", 'The strong rope has a better chance of holding up, though, be aware that if you are constantly tampering with the rope, even the strongest has a chance of breaking.', ""If you aren't sure of your current relationship with your pet, it is best to keep working with them until they trust you enough to allow you to pick them up and pet them."", 'This may take longer with skittish piggies, but never give up.', ',', ""Once your piggy is willing to trust you and do what you say, it's time to start looking into the many methods of training."", ""Guinea pigs are very fragile, and their brains work a bit differently from a dog's, so every training method will need to be tweaked before use with a guinea pig."", 'Clicker training and verbal markers are a few ways to train your guinea pig.', 'Clicker training is slightly easier than using a verbal marker, and requires a clicker, while using a verbal marker is more difficult and can have different results than what is expected.', 'Some owners have different needs than others, and some animals need a specific type of training.', 'As mentioned before, any training method chosen will need to be tweaked in many different ways to suit a guinea pig rather than a dog.', 'Different methods require different materials.', 'Some may need to be purchased, while others can just be found around the house.', 'Training a guinea pig is not as expensive as training a dog, per se, but cost is made up in effort.', ""If you choose to clicker train your guinea pig, you will need a soft clicker-be sure that it is not too loud or sharp for a guinea pig's ears-and, of course, treats."", 'Treats that have worked well for many guinea pig owners include chopped up carrots, celery (with veins removed), and lettuce torn up into little pieces.', 'Whatever the reward may be, always make sure that it is quick, chewable, and guinea pig-safe.']"

"Condition your guinea pig to the clicker or verbal marker. Once your guinea pig is well conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker, begin to slowly ease them into performing basic commands. Begin teaching your guinea pig.",How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks2,"To do this, put your guinea pig in a safe area-such as its cage-and click the clicker (or say the verbal marker). A second or so after clicking the clicker, give your guinea pig a treat. Repeat this several times until you think your guinea pig understands what the click, or marker, means.Occasionally, this will take a long time. To see if your guinea pig is properly conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker, act normal for several minutes, talking and playing with the guinea pig, and then, suddenly click the clicker or say the marker clearly and firmly. If your guinea pig looks at you, expecting a treat, they have been properly conditioned and you can move on with training. If they keep about their business, they do not yet understand what the marker means and need to be worked with on conditioning a bit more. Don't be discouraged if your guinea pig does this.  Skittish, hyper, stubborn, or impatient guinea pigs will be more difficult to train. It takes a lot of patience to get your guinea pig to learn a trick, and often times they will respond to a hand motion rather than a word-for example, if you were teaching your guinea pig to stand up, it would be easier for them to grasp if you held your finger over their head as an indication to do the trick in contrast to just saying ""stand up!"".Many people, before beginning to train their guinea pigs, work on targeting. Teaching targeting to a guinea pig is quite simple-to do so, hold a finger or some kind of long stick somewhere a few inches away from your guinea pig and wait. As soon as they get near the finger or stick and touch it, click or say the marker and treat. Do this about twenty or thirty times, or until your guinea pig touches it efficiently several times in a row. This may make training much easier.  There are several different methods, and some are easier than others. Try to get your guinea pig out for at least one 5-10 minute session each day. If either you or the pig become frustrated, treat and put them back in their cage for a little while.Keep in mind that guinea pigs' brains work differently than a cat's or dog's, so they may not process information as quickly as a larger animal.

"Place your guinea pig in a piggy-proof area that both of you are comfortable in. Hold a treat - or, if your pig has learned targeting, a finger - above the guinea pig's head. Once your guinea pig stands up on its hind legs, allow it to drop back down to all fours, and then click or use the verbal marker and treat. Continue to do this until your guinea pig does it correctly every time.",How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks3,"Ensure that there is nothing to pose a danger to your guinea pig, or you, and that there is nothing that your guinea pig can crawl under, save for a hidey house for them to retreat to if they feel the need.Training inside the cage works just as well in the beginning, if your guinea pig is more comfortable in their cage. It will become harder to train inside the cage, however, as you move on to more advanced tricks that require equipment, such as climbing over things. Keep in mind that anything you do use for a trick, such as a hoop, must be adjusted to fit the needs of your piggy.Remember that not all guinea pigs have the ability to focus on one task for more than a few minutes at a time, so changing up the training routine may help a guinea pig to learn more easily and not become bored.  Make sure that you are not holding it impossibly high, as the idea is to make your guinea pig stand up on its hind legs to receive the treat. Don't keep it too low either, or your pig may stand up, snatch the treat, and get away with it without learning anything. This could happen with any trick.  Praise your guinea pig as if they just did the hardest thing in the world, and then repeat.Try to time the click or word so that the moment they drop back down, you perform the action. This will eventually lead to the mindset of your piggy being like this: Trick-->Click/Marker-->Treat-->Praise. It may take time for the guinea pig to realize this, but when they do, training is much easier.When your guinea pig does this trick, make sure they do not stand up for too long, and allow them to lean on your hand for support if needed.

"Get a small garbage can or round, cylinder-shaped object of some sort. Place your guinea pig in the general area. Use a treat to lure your guinea pig to it. Stand back and see if the guinea pig will try to go around on its own. Eventually, begin only treating your guinea pig when they make a full circle around the object. Begin enforcing a hand motion. Take the garbage can away gradually.",How to Teach a Guinea Pig to Do Tricks4,"It can be any color, and any type, as long as it could not potentially harm your guinea pig. Set it in the area you will be training in.Be sure to turn it upside-down, so that your guinea pig will not knock it over as you begin to teach the trick. A garbage can that may have contained anything that could be harmful should not be used.  Gently lift them out of their cage and set them down near the garbage can/other object. Allow the guinea pig to sniff around if they feel the need. Some may ignore it, but this does not mean that they won't do the trick-have patience.  Hold out one of the treats and lure your guinea pig towards the garbage can. Move it slightly, further away and around it, until your guinea pig has completed a quarter of the circle. Click and treat.Do this three or four times, until your guinea pig becomes comfortable with moving around it a bit.  Every time the guinea pig moves forward a few steps, reward them with a click(or verbal marker) and a treat. Gradually increase the amount of steps they take before receiving the treat.Hopefully, your guinea pig will soon discover that moving around the garbage can does not go without rewards. Many will figure this out within a few minutes of doing that same thing, but if they don't, go back to luring and go on from there as many times as your guinea pig needs it.  Some guinea pigs will pick this up faster than others, and that's okay. No piggy is perfect, no matter how intelligent they may be.  The hand motion can be whatever you see fit, but I have found that holding a finger above the object, where the guinea pig can clearly see it, and moving it around in a circular motion. Saying the command ""Around!"" or ""Spin!"" may help as well, but verbal commands are more for the trainer than for the animal themselves.From this point on, only treat your guinea pig when they walk around after your hand motion. If they do it without your motion, just sit patiently until they are done and ask them to do it afterwards. If they do it, treat and praise them immensely. It takes many guinea pigs a long time to understand this, but, if the trainer is persistent, it will be very rewarding in the end.  Once the guinea pig is very good at walking around the garbage can on your hand motion, put the can up somewhere and do the motion. This can be very easy, or very hard, depending on the piggy.","['It can be any color, and any type, as long as it could not potentially harm your guinea pig.', 'Set it in the area you will be training in.', 'Be sure to turn it upside-down, so that your guinea pig will not knock it over as you begin to teach the trick.', 'A garbage can that may have contained anything that could be harmful should not be used.', 'Gently lift them out of their cage and set them down near the garbage can/other object.', 'Allow the guinea pig to sniff around if they feel the need.', ""Some may ignore it, but this does not mean that they won't do the trick-have patience."", 'Hold out one of the treats and lure your guinea pig towards the garbage can.', 'Move it slightly, further away and around it, until your guinea pig has completed a quarter of the circle.', 'Click and treat.', 'Do this three or four times, until your guinea pig becomes comfortable with moving around it a bit.', 'Every time the guinea pig moves forward a few steps, reward them with a click(or verbal marker) and a treat.', 'Gradually increase the amount of steps they take before receiving the treat.', 'Hopefully, your guinea pig will soon discover that moving around the garbage can does not go without rewards.', ""Many will figure this out within a few minutes of doing that same thing, but if they don't, go back to luring and go on from there as many times as your guinea pig needs it."", ""Some guinea pigs will pick this up faster than others, and that's okay."", 'No piggy is perfect, no matter how intelligent they may be.', 'The hand motion can be whatever you see fit, but I have found that holding a finger above the object, where the guinea pig can clearly see it, and moving it around in a circular motion.', 'Saying the command ""Around!""', 'or ""Spin!""', 'may help as well, but verbal commands are more for the trainer than for the animal themselves.', 'From this point on, only treat your guinea pig when they walk around after your hand motion.', 'If they do it without your motion, just sit patiently until they are done and ask them to do it afterwards.', 'If they do it, treat and praise them immensely.', 'It takes many guinea pigs a long time to understand this, but, if the trainer is persistent, it will be very rewarding in the end.', 'Once the guinea pig is very good at walking around the garbage can on your hand motion, put the can up somewhere and do the motion.', 'This can be very easy, or very hard, depending on the piggy.']"

Take every needed safety precaution every time.  While taking a guinea pig to shows to be judged by their fur color, pattern, and sleekness is not exactly everyone's cup of tea, it may be an option to do things with your guinea pig that involve training, showing off tricks, and meeting fellow guinea pig lovers.","['You and your guinea pig will not reach the harder stuff without knowing everything that you should know about training first.', 'First, work on targeting, conditioning your pig to the clicker, and doing simple tricks, such as ""Stand Up"".', ""Just because a trick doesn't necessarily exist doesn't mean you can't teach it to your piggy anyway."", 'Make up your own tricks, use your mind, and have fun with it!', 'If you are both bored out of your minds, there is no point in training at all.', 'Make very low hurdles-no more than two inches off the ground at the most-and teach your guinea pig to jump over them, create a safe agility course, or use lures to train your piggy to jump through a hoop.', ""The possibilities are endless!, I've said it once, I'll say it again; guinea pigs are much more fragile than the average dog or cat, so almost every trick meant for a larger animal must be adapted to suit the needs of a guinea pig."", 'Ensure that there is nothing to endanger your piggy before, during, or after training, or any other time.', 'Take every needed safety precaution every time.', ""While taking a guinea pig to shows to be judged by their fur color, pattern, and sleekness is not exactly everyone's cup of tea, it may be an option to do things with your guinea pig that involve training, showing off tricks, and meeting fellow guinea pig lovers.""]"

Reduce other factors that cause anxiety. Let your guinea pig explore its space. Slowly introduce yourself into its environment. Gradually work towards holding your guinea pig. Teach children how to hold guinea pigs properly. Give treats to reinforce good behavior. Learn your guinea pig's personality. Do not hit your guinea pig!,How to Get Your Guinea Pig to Stop Biting You2,"The guinea pig’s cage should be kept in a quiet area of the house to minimize stress. If your guinea pig bites, it is most likely that it feels threatened. Turn the TV down or off. Put other pets, if you have any, in another room. You want the guinea pig to only focus on you. Then when you act nicely, your guinea pig will associate you with a pleasant experience, not stress.  If you’ve just brought home your guinea pig, it will take a while for it to get used to its new home, its cage, and the room the cage is in. Let the guinea pig acclimate. Don’t immediately start playing with the guinea pig. Open the cage and let it investigate the opening. It is important to let your guinea pig explore. Once it knows its space and where the good hiding places are, it will feel more comfortable.As the pig gets more relaxed, place an exercise pen around the cage on the floor, and give the guinea pig time to explore. Do this when it is quiet — make sure there are no loud noises and no other pets around. Place fresh greens at the edge of the cage door and outside the cage to encourage exploration. Don’t push. Every guinea pig is different and this will take time.  Hang out without trying to engage your pig at first.Sit next to the cage. Talk quietly to the pig. Place tasty greens like parsley or dandelion greens in its space. Wait for the pig to get more comfortable before reaching out to pet it. Eventually, you can stick out a finger and let it explore your scent. Do not make contact until the guinea pig feels comfortable.Just sit and read or watch TV (quietly) next to the cage, while the pig gets used to your presence. Loud noises will frighten the guinea pig, so hang out together when the house is quiet and no dogs or cats are around.  Make physical contact for short periods. Do not grab and hold your guinea pig against its will. Once the pig accepts your hand in the cage, gradually and gently pet the guinea pig for a few seconds at a time. Try petting it behind the ears and on the top of the head at first. Only after it is comfortable in its setting and with you petting it, should you pick it up. Lift it up from under the chest just off the ground and then place it back down immediately. Work on this to get it used to being picked up.When you pick up a pig, use one hand to pick it up around the chest and the other to support the hindquarters. The guinea pig needs to feel completely supported so it doesn't worry about being dropped. Start by sitting on the floor. Pick it up and pet the it. Keep calm. If the pig gets agitated, put the pig back down before it feels the need to defend itself with their teeth.  Remember that nibbling/biting is the guinea pig's way of expressing itself. If the guinea pig feels uncomfortable being held by a child and resorts to biting, tell the child to put the pig down immediately.Under your supervision, have children sit down on the floor with a towel, a “Critter Cuddler Blanket”, or “Cuddle Cup” to hold the guinea pig.This way, there is a barrier between the child and the guinea pig to protect them both. Have the child pet the guinea pig gently and allow the guinea pig to wander away, so it does not feel trapped.  Don’t reward bad behavior. If it seems that the guinea pig is biting to get your attention, do not reward the behavior by giving attention. Come back later and pet the pig when it is calm. You will have to read the pig’s body language and if it seem calm and accepting, pet it and reward that behavior. If you attempt to abate its biting with treats, it will associate biting and bad behavior with tasty treats.  After a few months of living together, you will start to notice the guinea pig’s patterns. Avoid bothering the pig when it is napping, for instance, to decrease the chance of an adverse reaction to your attention.  This can injure the pig, but it will also teach the pig that it needs to defend itself against you - leading to more biting.It might be your gut reaction to lash out at a guinea pig after it bites you. Don’t give in to this instinct. Think about why the guinea pig resorted to biting and change your behavior.If someone held you against your will and you were afraid, had to urinate, or were hungry, would you consider biting? You don’t have another way of communicating, so you probably would sink your teeth into their hand too.","['The guinea pig’s cage should be kept in a quiet area of the house to minimize stress.', 'If your guinea pig bites, it is most likely that it feels threatened.', 'Turn the TV down or off.', 'Put other pets, if you have any, in another room.', 'You want the guinea pig to only focus on you.', 'Then when you act nicely, your guinea pig will associate you with a pleasant experience, not stress.', 'If you’ve just brought home your guinea pig, it will take a while for it to get used to its new home, its cage, and the room the cage is in.', 'Let the guinea pig acclimate.', 'Don’t immediately start playing with the guinea pig.', 'Open the cage and let it investigate the opening.', 'It is important to let your guinea pig explore.', 'Once it knows its space and where the good hiding places are, it will feel more comfortable.', 'As the pig gets more relaxed, place an exercise pen around the cage on the floor, and give the guinea pig time to explore.', 'Do this when it is quiet — make sure there are no loud noises and no other pets around.', 'Place fresh greens at the edge of the cage door and outside the cage to encourage exploration.', 'Don’t push.', 'Every guinea pig is different and this will take time.', 'Hang out without trying to engage your pig at first.', 'Sit next to the cage.', 'Talk quietly to the pig.', 'Place tasty greens like parsley or dandelion greens in its space.', 'Wait for the pig to get more comfortable before reaching out to pet it.', 'Eventually, you can stick out a finger and let it explore your scent.', 'Do not make contact until the guinea pig feels comfortable.', 'Just sit and read or watch TV (quietly) next to the cage, while the pig gets used to your presence.', 'Loud noises will frighten the guinea pig, so hang out together when the house is quiet and no dogs or cats are around.', 'Make physical contact for short periods.', 'Do not grab and hold your guinea pig against its will.', 'Once the pig accepts your hand in the cage, gradually and gently pet the guinea pig for a few seconds at a time.', 'Try petting it behind the ears and on the top of the head at first.', 'Only after it is comfortable in its setting and with you petting it, should you pick it up.', 'Lift it up from under the chest just off the ground and then place it back down immediately.', 'Work on this to get it used to being picked up.', 'When you pick up a pig, use one hand to pick it up around the chest and the other to support the hindquarters.', ""The guinea pig needs to feel completely supported so it doesn't worry about being dropped."", 'Start by sitting on the floor.', 'Pick it up and pet the it.', 'Keep calm.', 'If the pig gets agitated, put the pig back down before it feels the need to defend itself with their teeth.', ""Remember that nibbling/biting is the guinea pig's way of expressing itself."", 'If the guinea pig feels uncomfortable being held by a child and resorts to biting, tell the child to put the pig down immediately.', 'Under your supervision, have children sit down on the floor with a towel, a “Critter Cuddler Blanket”, or “Cuddle Cup” to hold the guinea pig.', 'This way, there is a barrier between the child and the guinea pig to protect them both.', 'Have the child pet the guinea pig gently and allow the guinea pig to wander away, so it does not feel trapped.', 'Don’t reward bad behavior.', 'If it seems that the guinea pig is biting to get your attention, do not reward the behavior by giving attention.', 'Come back later and pet the pig when it is calm.', 'You will have to read the pig’s body language and if it seem calm and accepting, pet it and reward that behavior.', 'If you attempt to abate its biting with treats, it will associate biting and bad behavior with tasty treats.', 'After a few months of living together, you will start to notice the guinea pig’s patterns.', 'Avoid bothering the pig when it is napping, for instance, to decrease the chance of an adverse reaction to your attention.', 'This can injure the pig, but it will also teach the pig that it needs to defend itself against you - leading to more biting.', 'It might be your gut reaction to lash out at a guinea pig after it bites you.', 'Don’t give in to this instinct.', 'Think about why the guinea pig resorted to biting and change your behavior.', 'If someone held you against your will and you were afraid, had to urinate, or were hungry, would you consider biting?', 'You don’t have another way of communicating, so you probably would sink your teeth into their hand too.']"

Make sure the saddle is positioned properly. Make sure the saddle fits correctly. Secure the front (main) cinch. Loosely secure the back (bucking) cinch. Lead the horse forward five steps. Attach the breast collar if you use one. Mount up!,Run up the stirrup irons on the stirrup leathers. Detach the girth (or cinch) and set it aside. Make sure the pad is lined up properly. Place the saddle. Replace the girth. Drop your stirrups before mounting.",How to Saddle a Horse,"Before you saddle your horse, you need to tie her so that she stays put. Check out this helpful wikiHow article to learn how to tie proper knots to keep a horse secured; cross-ties are preferred but not a must.If you tie your horse with the lead rope, it's always a safe idea to use a quick-release (or “slip”) knot. Consider slipping the tail of the lead rope through the quick release knot’s loop if your horse is knowledgeable about untying knots. , Horses can become very irritated and sore when ridden without being groomed properly; for both your safety and the horse’s you should never skip this step.Brush your horse’s body. Use a curry comb to remove any caked mud and then a stiff brush to remove the dust and hair brought up by the curry comb. Finish with a soft brush. Pay special attention to the horse’s back, belly, and girth area. Dirt or burrs underneath tack can irritate your horse to the point of misbehaving and even bucking.Remove tangles and burrs with a mane and tail comb. Be careful when brushing the tail; horses can and will kick.Clean the horse's hooves and check for lodged stones. Be careful or you may be kicked; you should not do this alone unless you are experienced.  Don't place a saddle over a wound.Check the horse for lumps, bumps, swelling, sores, and heat that could mean your horse is unsound and unfit for riding.  Your horse needs this to protect its back and keep the saddle in place. Place the saddle pad or blanket on the horse’s back.Put the pad a bit higher on the withers, then sliding it back into place just behind the mane. This ensures that the hair on the horse’s back lies flat beneath the pad and saddle. Make sure the blanket or pad is even on both sides.  At this point you will place a saddle depending on whether you ride Western or English style. This will likely be determined by your training or by what tack is available.A Western style saddle is designed for utility, since it was designed for a cowboy or rancher to use on the job. It has a saddle horn and a high back, making it a more comfortable seat for long hours on horseback.An English style saddle is sleek and small with no saddle horn and a low back. It is best for formal riding and show riding.  Stand on the left side of the horse, and flip the right-side cinches and stirrup over the seat of the saddle to keep them from getting caught beneath it. Then, swing the saddle over the horse. Rock the saddle back and forth into position and unfold the cinches and stirrup.Don't do this if you're working a young or unknown horse; it hurts to be hit in the head by a heavy stirrup if the horse acts up.  Line up the center line with the spine of the horse.Check that the stirrups hang equally on both sides, make sure that the front of the saddle sits just behind the withers, and not on top of the shoulder blades, You should be able to slide two fingers under the gullet (the curve of the saddle just under the horn) without cramping, and have 3-4 fingers-width of space between the horse’s forearms and the cinch.Don’t use a saddle if it doesn’t fit properly. An ill-fitting saddle can cause a horse to bolt or buck, and also can make a horse sore and cause bad habits.  This is a key step; you won’t be riding without a cinch! However, keep in mind that you should always cinch up a cinch gradually; you don’t want your horse to become cinch-sour.Pull the cinch under the horse’s belly, towards you, and slip the latigo strap down through the cinch buckle. Pull it all the way through and make sure neither the cinch nor the latigo strap are twisted.Lift the latigo and slip it through the saddle’s D-ring, from outside-in and leaving the ring angled towards the left. Make the cinch snug, but not overly so. Repeat the process once or twice more if you have a lot of length left in the latigo strap.Straighten the secured part of the strap so each layer is on top of the one beneath it, then gradually pull down on the tail of the latigo to tighten the cinch. Don’t tighten it all the way; that’ll come later.Move the tail of the latigo horizontally across the secured latigo and bringing it up through the saddle’s D-ring again, but from the right side. Now slip the tail down through the loop created and fasten the knot. This can be confusing; best to have an experienced saddler help you.Walk the horse around for a minute or two. This will let the horse relax to the saddle and stop bloating (a strategy many tricky horses will use to keep you from putting the saddle on too tight).Finish tightening the cinch. Do this pulling the top layer of latigo strap (not the tail) upwards. Keep the tightening a gradual process; don’t rush things.Re-tighten the knot. Done!, There should be two fingers-width of space between the horse’s belly and the bottom of the cinch.This process is similar to that of securing the front cinch, but instead of ending the process with a knot you’ll use the buckle.  This ensures the skin under the cinch isn’t wrinkled, to keep the horse from being pinched while riding.You can also gradually stretch each front leg forward for a few seconds; this also works to reduce tension in the horse's skin.  Do this by latching it to the saddle’s cinch and front D-rings.This will keep the saddle from slipping backwards and is especially helpful for on the trail, With your saddle in place, you are ready to mount (from the left side, of course!).  That's a fancy way to say you need to move the stirrup up higher and secure it in place so that it will not dangle down in your way; you do this by sliding the metal foot stirrup up and tucking it under the saddle.This keeps the stirrups out of the way, so that they won’t hit the horse as you lift the saddle over the horse’s back, You will put it back on in a moment, but taking it off keeps it from dangling while you try to position the saddle.Alternately, you can fold it over the top of the saddle, leaving it attached on the right-hand side.  If you are using a contoured pad (a common English style, which is shaped like the outline of a saddle), there should be about an inch of pad all the way around. For a square pad, be sure to leave at least one inch around the front edge of the saddle.The saddle should not be so far forward that in makes the shoulder movement hard.  Stand on the left-hand side of the horse, place the saddle on the pad on the horse's back with the pommel of the saddle just in front of the horse's withers.The arch of the pommel should be directly over the highest point of the horse's withers. The saddle will nestle in behind the horse's shoulder-blades.  Now that the saddle is in place, you need to replace the girth so that you can tighten the saddle and secure it in place. Attach the girth to the girth billets on the off side (the horse's right), then bring it up to the near side (the horse's left).As a guideline, the girth should come under the horse just behind its front legs. If you can see a gap between the elbow and the girth, the saddle is too far back.Fasten the girth securely. You should be able to get your hand between horse and girth, but it should be a snug fit.  Now you're ready to mount!","['Before you saddle your horse, you need to tie her so that she stays put.', 'Check out this helpful wikiHow article to learn how to tie proper knots to keep a horse secured;

Have the bridle ready. Take off the halter. Bring the horse's head down. Drape the reins over the horse. Change hands with the bridle. Separate the curb chain. Ask the horse to open its mouth. Put the bit in. Pull the crown over the ears. Fasten the buckles. Place the halter around the horse's neck. Unbuckle the straps. Pull the bridle off. Put the halter on. Check the horse for medical problems. Train the horse to stop chewing on bits. Try a different bit if your horse seems uncomfortable. Try a tongue port for tongue problems.,How to Put the Bit in a Horse's Mouth,"The bridle should be draped over your non-dominant arm, ready to be put on the horse.The bridle holds the bit in place. The bridle includes the reins, which is what you use to guide the horse, by pulling on them to move the bit.Depending on the type of bridle you have, you may need to unbuckle the nose strap to make it easier. You'll need to unbuckle English bridles, for instance. , The first part of a bridling a horse is taking its halter off. The halter is what fits over the horse's face so you can lead it around when you are not riding it. You usually take it off to ride, though some people do apply a bit and bridle over the halter.Unbuckle the strap, and pull the halter down off the horse's face.If your horse is accustomed to being bridled, you can take the halter completely off. If it's not, you should buckle just the strap around the horse's neck. That way, you can hold on to the horse if it tries to move away.  To put the bridle on, you'll need to bring the horse's head down. To bring its head down, use your hand between its ears to guide its head lower. You also want to move its head towards you if possible.Sometimes, the horse will need some convincing or will seem nervous. Don't try to shove its head down. Rather, keep gentle pressure on its head until it relaxes its head and moves it down.  Make sure the bridle is going the right direction, facing outward. When it's facing the correct way, put the reins over the horse to get them out of the way. Draping them is easier than having them drag on the ground.  Now, put the bridle in your dominant hand. Your dominant arm should be next to the horse, and you should be facing the same direction the horse is, except maybe turned slightly towards the horse. The top piece (crown) should be in your dominant hand, so you can pull it over the horse's head.  As you pull the crown up the horse's head, make sure the curb chain or strap is separate from the bit. Only certain types of bridles have curb chains, so yours may not have one. The curb chain goes under the horse's chin, which is why you need to separate it from the bit. Don't bang the horse's teeth with the curb strap.  No, you don't ask the horse with words. You tell the horse you want it to open its mouth by inserting your thumb into its mouth, behind the teeth.The teeth sit to the front of the horse's mouth, leaving a space behind them for the bit. Basically, you want to aim for the back edge of the mouth, along the side of the horse's head.Use your non-dominant hand to stick a thumb in the horse's mouth, as you're holding the crown with your dominant hand.If the horse seems reluctant, try moving your thumb around. Lightly touch the horse's gums. Doing so will tell the horse it needs to open its mouth.  Once the horse's mouth is open, slide the bit in. As you do, make sure you guide the bit between the horse's teeth. Be careful of the horse's teeth. Try not to touch them at all with the bit. Keep moving it gently back until the bit is in the back of the horse's mouth. At the same time, pull the crown of the bridle up over the horse's head, sliding the bit into place.The pressure should come from the crown moving up, not you pushing the bit with your left hand.If the bridle has a curb strap, be sure to guide that with your left hand, too.The bit goes over the horse's tongue, not under it.  Make sure to move the ears forward first. Don't smash them down, just use your hand to move them one at a time. As you do, pull the crown over each side until the bridle is in place to complete putting the bridle on.Some bridles have a brow band that stays across the forehead. Others have loops that go over the horse's ears.  Fasten the buckle around the neck, called the throatlatch. Make sure you can put about four fingers underneath it. After that, buckle the chin strap, leaving two fingers worth of space underneath it. In addition, you may need to buckle the curb strap.If you have an English bridle, you'll need to buckle the nose piece into place.  Once again, you'll use the halter to keep hold of the horse by strapping the halter around it's neck. Right now, it's not completely on. You're just using it as a way to steady the horse as you take the bridle off.  Now, do all the straps in reverse. Unbuckle the chin strap and the curb strap, if the bridle has one. Unbuckle the nose piece, if the bridle has one. Also, undo the throatlatch. In other words, make sure all the buckles are undone in anticipation of pulling the bridle off.  Using your dominant hand, take hold of the crown, and pull it over the horse's ears. Try not to smash the horse's ears as you pull it off. The horse should naturally release the bit, but as you pull the bridle off, use your non-dominant hand to guide the bit through the horse's teeth.  Once you've pulled the bridle off and away, unbuckle the halter from the neck. The halter goes on much like the bridle, except without the bit. Instead, you just have the headstall instead of the crown and a nose band instead of a bit. Slide the headstall over the horse's head as you pull the nose band over the horse's nose, making sure you don't smash the horse's ears or poke the horse in the eye. Buckle or clip the throatlatch into place around the horse's head.The lead line should be attached to the halter, so you can lead the horse back to the stall or wherever you want it to go.  If the horse doesn't want to take the bit or it seems uncomfortable with the bit, you should have the horse checked by a vet. Problems with the mouth, tongue, or teeth, including ulcers, can lead to problems with the bit because they will make the bit uncomfortable for the horse. If the vet doesn't find anything, try a horse dentist instead.  If your horse is always chewing on the bit, it can cause problems with the bridle set up, stretching out the leather, among other issues. One way you can help your horse is to slowly train it to become used to the bit without chewing by letting the horse wear it for a certain period each day.Start by putting the bit and bridle on the horse while its in its stall, making sure you don't use one that can catch on things in the stall. Also, take off the reins and nose band before putting it on. Stay with the horse will it has the bridle on. Leave it on for about an hour. Keep doing this training everyday until the horse seems comfortable and doesn't chew anymore.Next, try it on the longe line with a halter over the bridle. Work with the horse a little everyday until it seems comfortable without chewing the bit.After that, you can try riding the horse.  Some horses don't like certain bits, and they won't respond how you'd like to your rein movement. Bits put pressure on the tongue, so sometimes a bit that doesn't put as much pressure on the tongue can be helpful if your horse is sensitive. For instance, some curve across the tongue instead of going straight across.See if anyone you know has bits you can borrow to try on your horse. That way, you can see which one works the best.A different bit can also help retrain your horse not to put its tongue over the bit if it has picked up that habit.  If your horse keeps putting its tongue over the bit and you've tried other options, you can add a tongue port. It fits over the bit, and a rubber part hangs down. The rubber bit makes it harder for your horse to move its tongue over the bit.","['The bridle should be draped over your non-dominant arm, ready to be put on the horse.', 'The bridle holds the bit in

You're ready to get on and ride your horse!,How to Tack Up Using English Tack3,"There are multiple methods for doing this:The safest and most secure method is to unbuckle your horse's halter, take it off his nose, and slip it over his neck, with the halter still attached to a lead rope or one cross-tie.You can also simply put the reins over the horses neck before removing the halter.  Before bridling, check the bridle is straight and neat, and that the noseband and throatlash are unbuckled. You can then guide the bit into your horse's mouth.

Guide the bit in with your left hand.You can also hold the bridle underneath the browband, with your right arm reaching underneath your pony's head. Guide the bit in with your left hand.If your horse will not take the bit, you can squeeze the side of his lip, or slide your finger in his mouth and press at the part of his mouth without teeth.

"Ensure that bullying is the cause of weight loss. Set up the cage to optimise feeding opportunities. Set up a separate, smaller cage to accommodate feeding. Prepare the vegetables. Take the food to the cage. Separate the chosen cavy. Put in foods. Go away. Check on the cage. Return the guinea pig to the main cage.",How to Separate a Guinea Pig for Feeding,"If your guinea pig is losing weight, it's imperative that they see a vet. Unless you've actually seen other guinea pigs blocking them from food and you're certain this is the only cause of loss, get them checked by a vet to ensure there are no other problems.If the pecking order has changed, and there is another bottom pig, the previous lightest cavy may begin gaining weight while the new bottom pig loses. , If the guinea pig is being bullied at veggie time, chances are it's happening with hay, pellets and even water too.Have the same number of bowls, hay racks and bottles as guinea pigs - even if bullying is terrible, each pig can only hog one at once.Space these evenly around the cage (eg. in opposite corners) to that cavies cannot block access to all of them at once.  It's awfully inconvenient to do this with any kind of temporary enclosure, because you're going to have to set it up every single day (or twice a day if you feed vegetables mornings and evenings). Put this cage near to the main cage, so that they're still within earshot of the other guinea pigs.If you're only separating them for a short time, such as 20-30 minutes, you can have a small cage with bedding and a bowl for vegetables.If the separation is longer, they will also need a water bottle and possibly a larger cage.Add any other needs such as pellets and hay if you're also separating for equal access to those.  It's easier to put separate vegetables on a smaller plate when you're preparing them, rather than trying to divide it all up at the cage.If the guinea pig's access to veggies has been severely restricted, their main problem will be vitamin C deficiency, so focus on high vitamin C foods like capsicum (bell peppers).The guinea pig will likely be nervous at being put in a separate cage, so include some of their favourite food to entice them to start eating.Now is a good time to review How to Feed a Guinea Pig, to make sure you're giving them a good diet.  It's good to get all guinea pigs interested in dinner before you separate, so give them a good look at the food and perhaps a tidbit each now.  As gently as possible, remove the guinea pig from the cage and place her in the separate cage.  Place vegetables and/or hay and pellets into each cage.  Leave the guinea pigs for a while unless they are very comfortable eating around you.  When you return, check what the separated guinea pig has not eaten. You can also check their cage for poops at this stage, to ensure their digestion is working normally.If the guinea pig has been in the cage for half an hour, they should have gone to the bathroom at least once in this time.

Build your confidence. Be yourself. Maintain good hygiene. Have your own life.,How to Act Around the Girl You Like1,"Confidence is one of the most attractive qualities a person can possess. You don't have to be super sexy or built like Chris Hemsworth, either. All confidence requires is a firm belief in your own self-worth. If you believe it, that girl you like? She's going to believe it, too.It takes time and a little effort to build your confidence, especially if you're starting from a low point. Even if you don't believe in yourself, pretend like you do. Faking confidence actually tricks your brain into believing that you are confident!Stand up straight when you're walking, like you matter. Take up space like crossing your ankle across your knee when you're sitting. Leaning nonchalantly against a nearby surface. Avoid crossing your arms across your chest, or not making eye contact when you talk to people. Both of these are defensive gestures. , Part of being confident is being yourself and being okay with who that is. Trying to change yourself to be someone else isn't going to work with her. She's going to see that you're not comfortable with yourself and that you're lying about who you are and she won't be pleased.Show what makes you unique and why you're interesting. You don't have to walk around wearing a pocket protector (do people do that anymore?), but you don't have to hide that you're interested in computers. She will accept you and if she doesn't.. she's probably not worth your time!Don't try to be someone else, especially if you're trying to be the person you think she wants. If she isn't interested in the person you are, she's not the girl for you.  It's hard to attract the girl that you like when you overwhelm her with your smell and your greasy hair. Try to shower at least a couple times a week and use soap. Wear clothes that have been recently laundered. Reusing jeans and trousers is fine, as long as they aren't super dirty, but change your shirt each day.Be careful about using aftershave or cologne. A little goes a long way! You don't want to approach the girl you like in a cloud of cologne. Keep it down to a little spritz if you have to do wear it.Make sure to smell the deodorants before you buy them so you know how strong they smell and what they smell like. Again, you don't want to overwhelm her with smell, but a little deodorant (especially if you've just played a game like soccer or basketball) will make you seem much more put together.  Another incredibly important thing to remember is that you need to have your own life. Don't only focus on this one girl and try to be around her 24/7. It won't win you any prizes with her. In fact, you'll come across as needy and pathetic and she'll be far less likely to be interested in you.Pursue your own interests. If you're into soccer, join a team and play games. You could even (if you're feeling brave) invite her to come watch a game or to kick around a soccer ball with you.This will mean you have your own friends to hang out with, even if your groups overlap. Do things with your buddies rather than doing things only when you know that she'll be there, or doing things only with her.This doesn't mean that you ignore her completely. Of course not. When you see her around (either at school, or at mutual events), ask her what she's been up to and mention some of the things you've been doing (like teaching yourself a language, going rock climbing, kicking butt on Call of Duty).","['Confidence is one of the most attractive qualities a person can possess.', ""You don't have to be super sexy or built like Chris Hemsworth, either."", 'All confidence requires is a firm belief in your own self-worth.', 'If you believe it, that girl you like?', ""She's going to believe it, too."", ""It takes time and a little effort to build your confidence, especially if you're starting from a low point."", ""Even if you don't believe in yourself, pretend like you do."", ""Faking confidence actually tricks your brain into believing that you are confident!Stand up straight when you're walking, like you matter."", ""Take up space like crossing your ankle across your knee when you're sitting."", 'Leaning nonchalantly against a nearby surface.', 'Avoid crossing your arms across your chest, or not making eye contact when you talk to people.', 'Both of these are defensive gestures.', ', Part of being confident is being yourself and being okay with who that is.', ""Trying to change yourself to be someone else isn't going to work with her."", ""She's going to see that you're not comfortable with yourself and that you're lying about who you are and she won't be pleased."", ""Show what makes you unique and why you're interesting."", ""You don't have to walk around wearing a pocket protector (do people do that anymore?), but you don't have to hide that you're interested in computers."", ""She will accept you and if she doesn't.."", ""she's probably not worth your time!Don't try to be someone else, especially if you're trying to be the person you think she wants."", ""If she isn't interested in the person you are, she's not the girl for you."", ""It's hard to attract the girl that you like when you overwhelm her with your smell and your greasy hair."", 'Try to shower at least a couple times a week and use soap.', 'Wear clothes that have been recently laundered.', ""Reusing jeans and trousers is fine, as long as they aren't super dirty, but change your shirt each day."", 'Be careful about using aftershave or cologne.', 'A little goes a long way!', ""You don't want to approach the girl you like in a cloud of cologne."", 'Keep it down to a little spritz if you have to do wear it.', 'Make sure to smell the deodorants before you buy them so you know how strong they smell and what they smell like.', ""Again, you don't want to overwhelm her with smell, but a little deodorant (especially if you've just played a game like soccer or basketball) will make you seem much more put together."", 'Another incredibly important thing to remember is that you need to have your own life.', ""Don't only focus on this one girl and try to be around her 24/7."", ""It won't win you any prizes with her."", ""In fact, you'll come across as needy and pathetic and she'll be far less likely to be interested in you."", 'Pursue your own interests.', ""If you're into soccer, join a team and play games."", ""You could even (if you're feeling brave) invite her to come watch a game or to kick around a soccer ball with you."", 'This will mean you have your own friends to hang out with, even if your groups overlap.', ""Do things with your buddies rather than doing things only when you know that she'll be there, or doing things only with her."", ""This doesn't mean that you ignore her completely."", 'Of course not.', ""When you see her around (either at school, or at mutual events), ask her what she's been up to and mention some of the things you've been doing (like teaching yourself a language, going rock climbing, kicking butt on Call of Duty).""]"
Read her body language. Take note if she wants to spend time with you. Pay attention to her facial expressions. Trust your gut.,How to Find Out if a Girl Likes You1,"People will often express themselves through their body language. These signals can range from being obvious to subtle, requiring you to pay careful attention. Try to look out for some of the following examples of body language to determine if a girl might be interested in you or not:Standing or sitting close to you can be a sign of interest.If she makes eye contact often and smiles or laughs a lot she might be interested in you.Lightly touching your arms or shoulders can be a show of affection.If she crosses her arms, looks distracted or avoids contact with you she is probably uninterested.Some people may differ in regards to how they use their body language. These signs won't always apply. , Does she always come find you at lunch? Does she stop by your locker after school? Does she regularly visit you at work? Has she taken an interest in your activities? If she makes an effort to be around you, she obviously likes spending time with you. That may not mean that she is interested in you romantically but if she treats you different than all other guys there is a good chance she is.Many say that this is the best way to find out if someone is interested in you. Ask yourself if it seems like she wants to spend time with you. If the answer is yes, she probably likes you.  If she is willing to make eye contact with you, that is a good sign to begin with. Our facial expressions are great indicators of our feelings. If the girl gives you a warm welcoming look and a smile when you see her that is definitely a sign of positive feelings. However, sometimes people might fake smiles. Learn some of the following traits of genuine smiles and fake smiles to accurately gauge interest:Genuine smiles will involve the eyes. A person who is smiling will close their eyes and should have “crows-feet” wrinkles appear.Fake smiles will generally not involve the eyes at all. There won't be any closing of the eyes or “crows-feet” appearing with a fake smile.In a genuine smile, you shouldn't be able to see the persons bottom teeth. Fake smiles will likely reveal both the top and bottom rows of teeth.  If you think she likes you, there’s a pretty good chance she likes you.Try not to spend too much time thinking about it. It’s natural to be nervous about something like this but thinking about it constantly isn’t helping anything. Take stock of the information that you have available to you and decide on a course of action. It would be better to decide to ask her out or decide to do nothing then to keep torturing yourself.None of these clues guarantee that she is into you, but if you’re noticing two or three of them it is probably a good sign.","['People will often express themselves through their body language.', 'These signals can range from being obvious to subtle, requiring you to pay careful attention.', 'Try to look out for some of the following examples of body language to determine if a girl might be interested in you or not:Standing or sitting close to you can be a sign of interest.', 'If she makes eye contact often and smiles or laughs a lot she might be interested in you.', 'Lightly touching your arms or shoulders can be a show of affection.', 'If she crosses her arms, looks distracted or avoids contact with you she is probably uninterested.', 'Some people may differ in regards to how they use their body language.', ""These signs won't always apply."", ', Does she always come find you at lunch?', 'Does she stop by your locker after school?', 'Does she regularly visit you at work?', 'Has she taken an interest in your activities?', 'If she makes an effort to be around you, she obviously likes spending time with you.', 'That may not mean that she is interested in you romantically', 'but if she treats you different than all other guys there is a good chance she is.', 'Many say that this is the best way to find out if someone is interested in you.', 'Ask yourself if it seems like she wants to spend time with you.', 'If the answer is yes, she probably likes you.', 'If she is willing to make eye contact with you, that is a good sign to begin with.', 'Our facial expressions are great indicators of our feelings.', 'If the girl gives you a warm welcoming look and a smile when you see her that is definitely a sign of positive feelings.', 'However, sometimes people might fake smiles.', 'Learn some of the following traits of genuine smiles and fake smiles to accurately gauge interest:Genuine smiles will involve the eyes.', 'A person who is smiling will close their eyes and should have “crows-feet” wrinkles appear.', 'Fake smiles will generally not involve the eyes at all.', ""There won't be any closing of the eyes or “crows-feet” appearing with a fake smile."", ""In a genuine smile, you shouldn't be able to see the persons bottom teeth."", 'Fake smiles will likely reveal both the top and bottom rows of teeth.', 'If you think she likes you, there’s a pretty good chance she likes you.', 'Try not to spend too much time thinking about it.', 'It’s natural to be nervous about something like this but thinking about it constantly isn’t helping anything.', 'Take stock of the information that you have available to you and decide on a course of action.', 'It would be better to decide to ask her out or decide to do nothing then to keep torturing yourself.', 'None of these clues guarantee that she is into you, but if you’re noticing two or three of them it is probably a good sign.']"

Be respectful. Read her body language. Make eye contact. Don't ignore her friends.,How to Act Around the Girl You Like2,"Most guys are taught that they don't need to be respectful to women and act accordingly. Don't be one of those guys. Being respectful does not mean being a doormat or being ""whipped"" but it does mean treating the girl you as if she's an actual human being (which, surprisingly enough, she is).One way of showing respect is to stop doing something when she tells you to stop. For example, if you two were having a tickle war and she says ""Stop it!"" you stop, even if you think she's kidding. If she is kidding, she'll let you know and you can continue. Showing that you respect her right to say ""no"" in minor instances, will show that you are willing to respect her boundaries in more important instances.Be respectful to other people when you're around her (and in general). Don't talk about your ex as ""that weirdo"" or use language like that. Don't degrade women, or call guys ""pussies."" You'll come across as disrespectful to women and you'll come across as immature.  While a lot of guys say that women's body language is a mystery, it's really not that hard. Remember, you can tell when your sister is upset with you, or your female friend is trying to ignore you. The girl you like isn't going to be any different to understand.If she spends most of her time not making eye contact with you, or giving you short, one word answers, she either doesn't want to be around you, or she's upset with you. It's probably best to back off.A girl who wants you to stick around is going to be pretty obvious about it. She'll be turned towards you. She'll be making eye contact and smiling and laughing at the things you say (not derisively). She may even touch you (like on the arm when she's making a point).  It turns out that making eye contact is one of the biggest ways to flirt with someone that you're interested in. This is a good one that you can use in class, if you're sitting in the right spot, or even across the room if you're at a party.You can do this a couple different ways. A good way to do this is to make eye contact if she's across the room, catch her eye and hold it. Now, if the two of you are having a conversation, make sure to look deeply into her eyes. For some reason, that intense, long look can cause butterflies in the other person.Smile when you're looking at her, especially as you're making eye contact. A little smirk can be even better than a giant grin.  A girl's friends are incredibly important to her. She will listen to their opinions, even if she won't always follow their advice. If they don't like you it will cast a niggling bit of doubt in her own mind about you. To keep that from happening, you need to make sure that her friends like you.Learn some of the things that they like and ask them questions about those interests. For example, if her friends are super into a t.v. show, ask them a little about it (what's their favorite thing about the show, favorite characters, favorite episodes, things that irritate them about the show or the fandom).If you're having a conversation with the girl you like and her friends are around, make sure to include them in the conversation. You can still give her the long, heart-felt, languishing looks while making sure that her friends don't feel like you're ignoring them completely.Don't flirt with her friends, however. You don't want to come across as a player who is out to get whichever girl responds to his attentions. The girl you like won't think you're interested in her if you're flirting with all her friends, too.","[""Most guys are taught that they don't need to be respectful to women and act accordingly."", ""Don't be one of those guys."", 'Being respectful does not mean being a doormat or being ""whipped"" but it does mean treating the girl you as if she\'s an actual human being (which, surprisingly enough, she is).One way of showing respect is to stop doing something when she tells you to stop.', 'For example, if you two were having a tickle war and she says ""Stop it!""', ""you stop, even if you think she's kidding."", ""If she is kidding, she'll let you know and you can continue."", 'Showing that you respect her right to say ""no"" in minor instances, will show that you are willing to respect her boundaries in more important instances.', ""Be respectful to other people when you're around her (and in general)."", 'Don\'t talk about your ex as ""that weirdo"" or use language like that.', 'Don\'t degrade women, or call guys ""pussies.""', ""You'll come across as disrespectful to women and you'll come across as immature."", ""While a lot of guys say that women's body language is a mystery, it's really not that hard."", 'Remember, you can tell when your sister is upset with you, or your female friend is trying to ignore you.', ""The girl you like isn't going to be any different to understand."", ""If she spends most of her time not making eye contact with you, or giving you short, one word answers, she either doesn't want to be around you, or she's upset with you."", ""It's probably best to back off."", 'A girl who wants you to stick around is going to be pretty obvious about it.', ""She'll be turned towards you."", ""She'll be making eye contact and smiling and laughing at the things you say (not derisively)."", ""She may even touch you (like on the arm when she's making a point)."", ""It turns out that making eye contact is one of the biggest ways to flirt with someone that you're interested in."", ""This is a good one that you can use in class, if you're sitting in the right spot, or even across the room if you're at a party."", 'You can do this a couple different ways.', ""A good way to do this is to make eye contact if she's across the room, catch her eye and hold it."", 'Now, if the two of you are having a conversation, make sure to look deeply into her eyes.', 'For some reason, that intense, long look can cause butterflies in the other person.', ""Smile when you're looking at her, especially as you're making eye contact."", 'A little smirk can be even better than a giant grin.', ""A girl's friends are incredibly important to her."", ""She will listen to their opinions, even if she won't always follow their advice."", ""If they don't like you it will cast a niggling bit of doubt in her own mind about you."", 'To keep that from happening, you need to make sure that her friends like you.', 'Learn some of the things that they like and ask them questions about those interests.', ""For example, if her friends are super into a t.v. show, ask them a little about it (what's their favorite thing about the show, favorite characters, favorite episodes, things that irritate them about the show or the fandom).If you're having a conversation with the girl you like and her friends are around, make sure to include them in the conversation."", ""You can still give her the long, heart-felt, languishing looks while making sure that her friends don't feel like you're ignoring them completely."", ""Don't flirt with her friends, however."", ""You don't want to come across as a player who is out to get whichever girl responds to his attentions."", ""The girl you like won't think you're interested in her if you're flirting with all her friends, too.""]"
Ask her questions. Listen. Make her laugh. Flirt with her. Tell her how you feel.,How to Act Around the Girl You Like3,"When you're talking to the girl you like, you want to make her feel special. People like it when others take an interest in them and the girl you like is no different. Showing that you care about her thoughts will make her more interested in you, as a result.Ask her opinion on things, even if it's something silly. For example: say you're wearing a shirt that your friend doesn't like, ask for her opinion on whether the shirt is silly or not. Tell her she's the final judge. It'll make her laugh and feel important.Pay attention to the things that she does and says, so you can ask questions about it. For example, if she mentions going rock climbing, ask her how she got started rock climbing and what she enjoys about it. People like talking about themselves, so before you jump in with stories of your own, ask her another question about what she thinks.  In this day and age people have really lost the skill of listening (Really listening) to one another. Real listening is when you take the time to absorb what someone is saying rather than thinking about the next thing you're going to say or what you're going to have for dinner.For example: even if you're at a loud party, when you're having a conversation with her, maintain eye contact, ask questions and if your mind strays, ask for clarification (you can use the loud party as an excuse: ""Sorry, it's really loud in here. Can you repeat what you just said?"").To this end, when you're having a conversation with her, don't fidget with stuff, or keep looking all around the room, or keep checking your phone. She'll feel that you don't really care what she has to say.  Laughter is a great way to bond with someone. This doesn't mean that you need to be the class clown (Actually, it will probably work best if you aren't). All this means is that you make her laugh and say a few entertaining things. Now, everyone has a different sense of humor and you know her best, but if you're not sure there are a few things to do that rarely fail.Gently poke fun at yourself. You don't have to do a big self-deprecating speech (in fact that will make you seem not confident), but a few jabs at yourself will get her laughing and show that you don't take yourself too seriously. For example: talk about how you got hit in the head with a soccer ball that day when you weren't paying attention, or that time you went to the wrong class because you forgot what day it was.Bring up something funny that you saw that day (or within the previous week). It should be something a little out of the ordinary and funny. For example: ask her if she's ever ended up entangled with a bunch of zombies and then tell her about the zombie walk you accidentally ended up in the middle of.  Flirting can be very hit or miss and is to be used with caution. Since everyone is different, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flirting with someone. Humor and eye contact are the two big ones, but you can subtly flirt in other ways.Unless she's made it explicitly clear, flirting really obviously can be off-putting to some girls. Keep that in mind when you're hanging out with her. If you aren't a good flirt, eye contact and humor will probably be your best bets.Flirting over text, however, can be a great, non-threatening type of flirting. Of course, you want this to be only supplementary to your interactions in person. Keep texts short, sometimes a picture is worth more than a hundred words (especially a funny picture; do NOT send explicit pictures unless she has actually asked for them!). It's good to have a reason to text. You could say something like ""saw this and thought of you"" (and then send a picture).Giving her the right compliment can be a great way of expressing interest and flirting. Don't do something basic like ""you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met"" (it comes across as insincere). Instead, say something like ""Did you realize your sweater matches your eyes? it's a beautiful color,"" or ""of course you aced that test, you're super smart!"", In the end, the best way to act around the girl you like is to tell her how you feel. She might otherwise never know. It can seem super intimidating or scary to bare your feelings like that (and it is a very brave act!). But, otherwise you both will be in this uncomfortable holding pattern.Don't do it in front of everyone. Choose a time and place where you're both sober and in your right mind. Simply say ""Hey, I really like you and I was wondering if you'd like to go on a date sometime.""Don't do this over the phone or text or social media, because you will come across as a coward and most girl's don't find that a particularly attractive quality.Respect her decision, even if she says ""no."" It can hurt when someone says no, but remember that it isn't about you as a person, it's simply that your proposal didn't work for her (because she isn't interested, or because she already has a boyfriend, or she's into girls, etc.). You can ask why if you must, but if she simply says ""Because I'm not interested"" that's your answer and leave it at that.If she says ""yes,"" then yay! Now you two can get to planning a super fun first date. The relationship might not work out, but you proved your bravery by asking her out and your worth by treating her with respect.","[""When you're talking to the girl you like, you want to make her feel special."", 'People like it when others take an interest in them and the girl you like is no different.', 'Showing that you care about her thoughts will make her more interested in you, as a result.', ""Ask her opinion on things, even if it's something silly."", ""For example: say you're wearing a shirt that your friend doesn't like, ask for her opinion on whether the shirt is silly or not."", ""Tell her she's the final judge."", ""It'll make her laugh and feel important."", 'Pay attention to the things that she does and says, so you can ask questions about it.', 'For example, if she mentions going rock climbing, ask her how she got started rock climbing and what she enjoys about it.', 'People like talking about themselves, so before you jump in with stories of your own, ask her another question about what she thinks.', 'In this day and age people have really lost the skill of listening (Really listening) to one another.', ""Real listening is when you take the time to absorb what someone is saying rather than thinking about the next thing you're going to say or what you're going to have for dinner."", 'For example: even if you\'re at a loud party, when you\'re having a conversation with her, maintain eye contact, ask questions and if your mind strays, ask for clarification (you can use the loud party as an excuse: ""Sorry, it\'s really loud in here.', 'Can you repeat what you just said?"").To this end, when you\'re having a conversation with her, don\'t fidget with stuff, or keep looking all around the room, or keep checking your phone.', ""She'll feel that you don't really care what she has to say."", 'Laughter is a great way to bond with someone.', ""This doesn't mean that you need to be the class clown (Actually, it will probably work best if you aren't)."", 'All this means is that you make her laugh and say a few entertaining things.', ""Now, everyone has a different sense of humor and you know her best, but if you're not sure there are a few things to do that rarely fail."", 'Gently poke fun at yourself.', ""You don't have to do a big self-deprecating speech (in fact that will make you seem not confident), but a few jabs at yourself will get her laughing and show that you don't take yourself too seriously."", ""For example: talk about how you got hit in the head with a soccer ball that day when you weren't paying attention, or that time you went to the wrong class because you forgot what day it was."", 'Bring up something funny that you saw that day (or within the previous week).', 'It should be something a little out of the ordinary and funny.', ""For example: ask her if she's ever ended up entangled with a bunch of zombies and then tell her about the zombie walk you accidentally ended up in the middle of."", 'Flirting can be very hit or miss and is to be used with caution.', 'Since everyone is different, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flirting with someone.', 'Humor and eye contact are the two big ones, but you can subtly flirt in other ways.', ""Unless she's made it explicitly clear, flirting really obviously can be off-putting to some girls."", ""Keep that in mind when you're hanging out with her."", ""If you aren't a good flirt, eye contact and humor will probably be your best bets."", 'Flirting over text, however, can be a great, non-threatening type of flirting.', 'Of course, you want this to be only supplementary to your interactions in person.', 'Keep texts short, sometimes a picture is worth more than a hundred words (especially a funny picture;

Pay attention to how she talks and what she talks about. Notice interruptions. Look for humor. Notice playful behavior. Look out for jealousy.,How to Find Out if a Girl Likes You2,"A girl who is interested in you will laugh more often and her voice may rise in pitch.She might even say flirtatious things, like complimenting you on how you look today. If she is more willing to talk about personal topics with you, such as your plans for the future, she might be interested romantically.If you’re lucky, she’ll even give you helpful hints for dates like mentioning that she loves a particular band or wants to go dancing. Giving you a compliment such as “Oh I love your shirt! That band is one of my favorites.” can indicate interest.If she asks you about what you are doing later on in the week she might be subtly asking you to spend some time with her.  If the person is constantly interrupting you or doesn’t seem focused on the conversation then they are probably not romantically interested in you. Try to pay attention during your time together for signs that she may not be interested in you:Interruptions are rarely a result of a girl being shy, which makes it a good indicator.Gauge the responses you get during a conversation. For example if you were just explaining how well your garden is growing and she responds with “Uh-huh....” she is likely not interested.Silence can be a good indicator that there isn't a good connection.

Ask her out on a date. Describe your feelings to her. Write her a letter. Ask her friends.,How to Find Out if a Girl Likes You3,"The simplest way to find out if she likes you is to ask her out on a romantic date. Make sure she understands that this date goes beyond just being friends. For example, a dinner and a movie will seem more serious and romantic than grabbing lunch together.  You need to tell her how you feel if you expect her to tell you how she feels. If you think she may not understand where you are coming from when you ask her out on a date, try telling her how you feel first. Explain that you have romantic feelings for her and tell her the reasons why. Once you’re finished, you should ask her how she feels.If she says no that’s okay. Don’t take it personally. It may hurt your feelings but at least you went for it. That requires a lot more bravery than most people can muster.  Letters are pretty neat. Everyone likes getting a letter. If you don’t want to talk to her in person, write her a letter telling her your feelings, This is sort of a childish way to figure out if a girl likes you, but it may work. If her friends know the girl likes you and that she is waiting for you to ask her out on a date they may be inclined to tell you.If the girl wants to keep it a secret she may tell her friends to stay quiet. Take what her friends say with a grain of salt.","['The simplest way to find out if she likes you is to ask her out on a romantic date.', 'Make sure she understands that this date goes beyond just being friends.', 'For example, a dinner and a movie will seem more serious and romantic than grabbing lunch together.', 'You need to tell her how you feel if you expect her to tell you how she feels.', 'If you think she may not understand where you are coming from when you ask her out on a date, try telling her how you feel first.', 'Explain that you have romantic feelings for her and tell her the reasons why.', 'Once you’re finished, you should ask her how she feels.', 'If she says no that’s okay.', 'Don’t take it personally.', 'It may hurt your feelings but at least you went for it.', 'That requires a lot more bravery than most people can muster.', 'Letters are pretty neat.', 'Everyone likes getting a letter.', 'If you don’t want to talk to her in person, write her a letter telling her your feelings, This is sort of a childish way to figure out if a girl likes you, but it may work.', 'If her friends know the girl likes you and that she is waiting for you to ask her out on a date they may be inclined to tell you.', 'If the girl wants to keep it a secret she may tell her friends to stay quiet.', 'Take what her friends say with a grain of salt.']"
See if she's being intentional with you. Pay attention to her vulnerability with you. Look for hints. Notice how she interacts with her friends. Pay attention to her actions in group settings. Look at social media. Don't overanalyze. Watch for flirting. Observe her body language. See if her wardrobe/look changes. Make the effort to understand her. Ask her to hang out. Get information from her friends or from others. Initiate flirting with her. Ask her boldly.,"How to Tell if a Girl Likes You, or Is Interested","One of the first things that might stand out to you, making you curious if a girl is interested in you, is her desire to be intentional with you. Is there a girl in your life who is really trying to get to know you or spend time with you? A girl may be interested in you if she's asking you personal questions, showing that she cares about your life and wants to know you more.Don't confuse this with a girl who is just being friendly. Some girls may just be really good at initiating conversation with people or may have a knack for small talk. Look beyond that to the girls who seem to be going out of their way to learn more about you and develop a relationship with you.When a girl spends time getting to know you and learns about your hobbies and interests, you may begin to see her taking interests in those things as well. She may be doing this so that you two have more in common or so that you find her more interesting and inviting. , Not only might a girl who is interested in you seek out ways to get to know you, she may also become more vulnerable around you. If you are unsure if a girl likes you, pay attention to how much she is opening up around you. If you ask her somewhat personal questions and she seems offended or taken aback, it may be a sign that she's not interested in you. But if she seems willing to open up and tell you things she wouldn't tell everyone, she may be interested in you.Girls can be complicated and there is no perfect formula for understanding them, so don't assume that just because she is opening up to you she must like you. On the opposite end, don't assume that just because she is more closed off or quiet that she dislikes you. Some girls feel more comfortable being vulnerable with people while others take more time to show their entire self to people.Be patient with girls and if you feel that one may like you, try to be vulnerable with her and see if she is vulnerable back. Overtime if you continue this she should open up if she's interested in you.  Girls often like to drop hints to people that they are interested in so that they don't have to be the first one to make a move. These can range from sharing their interests, or explaining that they want to do something and don't have someone to do it with. Look for signs that a girl is obviously trying to show you that she wants you to initiate.Hints can be difficult because they are just that -- hints -- and it can hard to know what the girl is actually communicating. If she says she's been wanting to see a certain movie but no one has wanted to go with her, she may be hinting to you that you should ask to go with her, or she may just be stating a fact. As always feel out the situation to figure out what she's really trying to say. In this case, you may just have to be bold and ask her what she's really trying to say, or initiate with her and risk the chance that she wasn't hinting anything to you.Another way a girl might drop a hint is explaining she needs help on something. This is the opportunity for you to offer to help her! Even if she really just needs help and isn't trying to hint at anything, you haven't lost anything by offering your help.  If a girl is interested in you and has told her friends that she likes you, you may be able to see a reaction from all of them when you approach them. Some girls are subtle and are good at hiding their emotions, while others may be surrounded by a group of friends that start giggling or acting strange when you walk up to them. Changes in behavior in a girl when you approach can be a helpful sign to show she likes you.  If the two of you are involved in the same organization or have the same group of friends, pay attention to how she is spending her time in group settings. Is she spending time with a particular group of friends the whole time, is she jumping from group to group, or is she spending most of her time with you? If you find that she is giving you extra attention over others, it may be because she's into you.If you two are already close friends and she would normally spend more time with you, this probably isn't helpful. But, if you are in this situation and you find that she's spending a lot of time with someone else instead of you, it may be a sign that she is interested in that other person and not you.If you are in a room with a group of people and she's across the room, try making eye contact with her. You may notice that she's already been looking at you or when she notices you looking at her she may smile shyly or show that she's happy to see you. Watch the expression that comes on her face whenever you make eye contact with her. It could be a sign that she likes you.  Some girls will use social media as an outlet to show others what is going on in their lives, and so if you are a big part of her life you may see that she has several pictures with you that she's posted. She also may be very attentive to your social media pages, liking your pictures and statuses. Any of these things could be a sign that she's into you.As always, some girls won't use social media to broadcast your relationship, especially if they are insecure or aren't sure that you like them as well. Just because a girl doesn't have pictures of you on her Instagram or Facebook, doesn't mean she's not into you.  Because relationships and people are complicated and can't be put into a box, you may meet a girl who is crazy about you and doesn't show any of these signs, or you may meet someone who has no interest in you and does all of these things. With that being said, try not to overanalyze her behavior. Be patient, get to know her, and over time you may be able to have a conversation about it rather than just depending on her actions for complete confidence that she likes you.  One of the common ways to tell if a girl likes you is when she flirts with you. A girl may be interested in you if she laughs a lot when she's around you, if she initiates physical touch, like touching your shoulder or giving you hugs, or if she playfully argues with you. Because every girl is different, flirting doesn't always mean a girl is interested, but it's a good beginning sign to know if she sees you as potential.Some girls don't realize they are flirting, or their natural way to interact with others is by being somewhat flirty and playful. Others won't flirt at all for fear of rejection, so don't place girls in a box when it comes to flirting.On the other hand, a girl may be interested in you, but not flirt with you because she is shy or nervous. So, in this case pay attention to the less obvious signs of flirting. Look to see if she blushes when she's around you, if she laughs nervously at your jokes, or she shifts her clothes or hair while she's talking to you. These could all be signs that she's into you, but doesn't feel comfortable outright flirting with you. As she walks away, look to see if there's still a smile on her face. This could definitely be a sign that she likes you, because you've left her feeling giddy after she's talked to you.  Body language is a great way to feel out a situation, and figure out if a girl is interested in you. If you are with a girl and she seems distant, or her arms are crossed in front of her, and she's not making eye contact with you, it may be a sign that she's not interested. But, if she is being intentional about making eye contact with you, moves closer to you as you two talk, and tenderly smiles at you, she may like you.Watch how she holds herself, too. If there is a girl who really wants to get your attention, she may look more confident when she's around you, because she wants to show you that she's worth looking at. She may do this around you and engage with you, or she may show confidence but act like she's preoccupied with other things. This may be because she's trying to play hard to get, or she wants you to be jealous.Sometimes, a girl can feel distant because she is nervous, uncomfortable, or doesn't know how to act around you. It doesn't always mean that she isn't interested in you, so in this situation the best way to make her comfortable is to show her that she can trust you. Cozy up to her and look into her eyes, instead. She may feel uncomfortable but eventually she may decide opening up to you physically is worth the risk.As with flirting, don't believe that just because a girl makes eye contact with you it means she likes you. You really have to feel out the situation with girls and observe how she acts around others as well. If she seems tender and open with everyone else, she may not be acting that way around you because she likes you. However, if she seems more closed off with others, but with you her body language shows she is more at ease or flirty, then it may be evidence that she likes you.  If a girl is trying to impress you, she may spend more time on her outfit, hair, or makeup. She wants you to notice her and think she's attractive, so whenever she knows that she's going to be around you, she's likely going to primp herself more than she usually does. If you notice that she suddenly looks more stylish or done up than she used to, it may be a sign that she's into you.This could be difficult to tell if the girl you think is interested in you has always looked really nice. If this is the case, continue to pay attention to see if she does something different. This will require you to be more observant than you might have been. See if she changes her hair color, tries out a new style of clothing, or wears a new perfume.As with all of the other tips, don't expect that every girl is going to dress nicer for you when they are interested in you. It's really a girl's personal preference, and some won't see the need to make you notice them by their looks. Some girls may feel confident enough to just be themselves.Also, don't get confused if a girl is dressing up, but she's really doing it for someone else. Try to pay attention to who she is dressing up around and when she's dressing up. For example, if you see her with a group of her friends, and she wasn't expecting to see you, look to see if she is dressed up. If she seems to be dressed rather casually and hasn't done anything special to her hair or makeup, but she looks much more dolled up when she's around you, it may be because she's interested in you.  While a girl may try to get to know you better because she likes you, a great way to understand her feelings and intentions is by getting to know her better yourself. As you spend time with her and talk with her, ask her questions about her life and pay attention to how she relates to you and to others.This is the step where you can also begin to talk about your relationship, if you are relatively confident something is going on between the two of you.While this is similar to looking for intentionality and vulnerability, it's different in that you play bigger role. You want to make her feel comfortable and that she's in a safe place. And, if you like her too you should have the desire to understand who she is and how she works.  If you are unsure if a girl is interested in you, the best way to find out is by asking her to spend time with you. A girl who is interested in someone will almost certainly say yes to this, and someone who isn't interested in you may or may not say yes, but it will take you one step further to figuring out how she feels about you.Ask her to hang out in a casual setting, that way if she's actually not interested you haven't placed yourself in an awkward position. If she is interested it will give her a comfortable, relaxed environment to open up to you. Observe her throughout the night to determine if she seems like she just sees you as a friend or if she's looking at you as more than that.  Maybe you've looked for all of the other signs that a girl likes you, but are still unsure. Now is the time where you can seek out information and insight from her friends and others. Talk to other people who have been in relationships and ask them how they knew the other was interested. Ask her friends if she is interested in anyone or, if they already know you are interested in her too, ask them how you can best approach their friend.Don't use her friends as an excuse to not be bold and take risks yourself. You don't want her friends to be the messengers to her, and you definitely don't want to tell her you are interested in her through her friends. Use her friends as helpful advice on how you can better act in this situation, and if you are absolutely clueless they may steer you in a good direction.  Some girls will flirt no matter who the person is, but others won't flirt unless they have first been flirted with. If this is your girl, and she seems shy and uncertain, try flirting with her, speaking tenderly with her, laughing with her, and giving her hugs. If she's interested in you she may flirt back, and if walls still seem to be up it might be a sign that she's not into you.  This is not always a great idea, especially if you are unsure if a girl is interested in you. But if you feel like you've had some time to ""read the signs"" and are pretty confident that she's into you, then you can try asking her boldly if she likes you are is interested. Do this in a gentle way, and only if you plan to take the relationship further.If you don't plan to ask this girl out or develop a relationship with her, asking her if she likes you and then doing nothing may come across as hurtful or insincere. So, if you don't like her then just leave it at that -- there's really no reason for you to know if she likes you. But if you do like her and want the relationship to move into something different, than ask her if she's interested in you and explain that you feel the same way.A gentle way to approach this would be by first explaining to her that you are interested in her and then leaving her the option to tell you how she feels about you. This creates a safe zone for her, which allows her to be vulnerable but with the knowledge that it's not in vain.","['One of the first things that might stand out to you, making you curious if a girl

"Start off by writing a simple note. Find out where her locker is and slip it in there, or be creative and slip in one of her books. Leave subtle hints that it's you, don't leave her hanging. Try leaving the notes in places that you are in. Try to see her reaction. If you see she is trying really hard to find out her secret admirer, leave her a note saying ""meet me here(then time and place)""Don't come out and say your name.",How to Write a Secret Admirer Letter to Your Crush,"But, you must be careful not to seem like a stalker. Today, that is a huge turn-off for any girl. Don't make it feel ""mysterious"" or ""freaky"" like you're watching her. Try simply and subtly explaining your feelings, and make an attempt of writing your name.For example, write something like this:Hi, (name here). You are one of the prettiest girls in school. Remember that and don't believe anyone who says you're not.Sincerely, (write name in pen and scribble out, or maybe erase if in pencil, to let her know you are genuine and thought about telling her your feelings and you're not just a stalker)This is a great way to let a girl feel great. With this one little sign that some person is out there and is willing to love her and thinks she's pretty will leave her smiling for days. , Just be careful not to put it in a really weird place that will make her feel uncomfortable. Alternatively, you can get your friend to give it to that person.  Write ""see you in chemistry"" or ""see you on the bus"" to leave her guessing.  Like in a class you both share, especially if she's next to you. If she is thrilled to get a secret admirer letter and happy someone feels this way, she will tell you everything, which is a good sign. If she acts annoyed, you probably have gone too far and should stop. Don't stop immediately, or she will get tipped off.  If she's happy, trust me, this is a good sign. Whether she likes you or not, she will appreciate the special little steps you took in order to make her happy and feel loved. If she looks annoyed, it's a good idea to stop gradually. Try apologizing in one of your last notes and watch her reaction while she reads it. If she likes the extra attention, she will try very hard to find out who you are, but if she looks relieved, you have gone too far in her mind and you should forget about the notes. If she tells her friends right away, she is happy and wants to find out more.  Be careful not to give it away. If she doesn't feel the same way she will try to ignore you or tease you and make fun. If she does, she will first try to see if you are serious. One of a girl's biggest fears when she gets a note is if the ""secret admirer"" really likes her or not, or if he's just trying to get her hopes up just to watch her fall.","['But, you must be careful not to seem like a stalker.', 'Today, that is a huge turn-off for any girl.', 'Don\'t make it feel ""mysterious"" or ""freaky"" like you\'re watching her.', 'Try simply and subtly explaining your feelings, and make an attempt of writing your name.', 'For example, write something like this:Hi, (name here).', 'You are one of the prettiest girls in school.', ""Remember that and don't believe anyone who says you're not."", ""Sincerely, (write name in pen and scribble out, or maybe erase if in pencil, to let her know you are genuine and thought about telling her your feelings and you're not just a stalker)This is a great way to let a girl feel great."", ""With this one little sign that some person is out there and is willing to love her and thinks she's pretty will leave her smiling for days."", ', Just be careful not to put it in a really weird place that will make her feel uncomfortable.', 'Alternatively, you can get your friend to give it to that person.', 'Write ""see you in chemistry"" or ""see you on the bus"" to leave her guessing.', ""Like in a class you both share, especially if she's next to you."", 'If she is thrilled to get a secret admirer letter and happy someone feels this way, she will tell you everything, which is a good sign.', 'If she acts annoyed, you probably have gone too far and should stop.', ""Don't stop immediately, or she will get tipped off."", ""If she's happy, trust me, this is a good sign."", 'Whether she likes you or not, she will appreciate the special little steps you took in order to make her happy and feel loved.', ""If she looks annoyed, it's a good idea to stop gradually."", 'Try apologizing in one of your last notes and watch her reaction while she reads it.', 'If she likes the extra attention, she will try very hard to find out who you are, but if she looks relieved, you have gone too far in her mind and you should forget about the notes.', 'If she tells her friends right away, she is happy and wants to find out more.', 'Be careful not to give it away.', ""If she doesn't feel the same way she will try to ignore you or tease you and make fun."", 'If she does, she will first try to see if you are serious.', 'One of a girl\'s biggest fears when she gets a note is if the ""secret admirer"" really likes her or not, or if he\'s just trying to get her hopes up just to watch her fall.']"
Notice the amount of alone time she seeks out with you. Watch for eye contact. Pay attention to her reaction to your interactions with others. Pay attention to the way she touches you. Notice whether she laughs at your jokes or not. Watch for the lean in. Notice the blush. Look for a head tilt. Look out for preening. Pay attention to her feet. Listen to what she says. Pay attention to what her friends say. Listen to your gut. Flirt a little. Tomboys are pretty interested in sports. Put it all in context. Ask. Accept that she might just want to be your friend.,How to Tell if a Tomboy Likes You,"In particular, see if there’s a change. If you two used to hang out all the time alone, and she’s suddenly reluctant to do that, it’s possible that she has a crush on you and is feeling nervous about it. On the other hand, if you usually only hang out in a group, and she starts seeking out time alone with you, she may have a crush on you.A tomboy may be more willing to make it clear that she is seeking out time with you than other girls would. Boys are often socialized to ask directly for what they want instead of being coy. It’s likely that she’s modeling her behavior on more masculine flirting, so she may be very direct. , This one is a little tricky, because good eye contact could also just mean good social skills. If you observe that she’s making eye contact a little longer than what seems normal, that’s a good sign that she’s into you. Alternatively, if you notice that she’s refusing to meet your gaze (especially if this is different from before), this may be a sign that she’s feeling shy about looking at you because she likes you. , Particularly if it seems like you’re flirting with someone else, does she look put off or angry? Does she tend to avoid you or act aggressively after she sees you do this?Especially if you have a crush on her too, don’t flirt with other people just to make her jealous. This is confusing (and mean) both her and the person you’re flirting with. Just interact normally and see if a normal interaction makes her appear jealous.  Is she “accidentally” touching you a lot? For example, does she bump into you with her elbow at the lunch table when there’s plenty of room to avoid you? Do her fingers brush against yours when she hands you a pencil? If so, there’s a good chance she’s “accidentally” touching you on purpose because she likes you.Touch is often key in tomboy flirting style, because masculine flirting tends to include more touching than feminine flirting.Does she hit you more than usual? Unfortunately, one way that boys are socialized to show affection is through wrestling and punching. A tomboy or girl who emulates more masculine behavior might do the same thing if she has a crush on you.If this is the case and it makes you uncomfortable, it’s okay to discourage this behavior or tell an adult if you think it’s gotten out of hand.  In particular, does she laugh even when your jokes aren’t even that funny, or when other people don’t seem to even notice you’re joking? This is a pretty good sign that she’s into you, especially if she hasn’t always laughed at your jokes or given any indication that she thinks you’re funny. In particular, pay attention her reactions to some light teasing. Don’t hurt her feelings or be mean. Just tease her enough to let her know you’re paying attention to her, and see if this causes a bit of blushing or extra laughter.  Leaning toward someone is a sign that you’re engaged and paying attention. Particularly if the two of you are part of a larger group of people, if she leans in toward you, there’s a good chance she’s inviting further conversation with you, because she’s interested in you. On the other hand, she could just be having a hard time hearing what you’re saying, so be look for other signs of attraction too.  Blushing is a sign that she’s either nervous or excited, either of which can be a good indication that she likes you. In particular, if this girl has been your friend for a while, pay attention to whether she has recently started blushing when you talk. , Head tilting indicates that a person is paying good attention to what you’re saying and that they’re engaged in thinking about your conversation. This action, combined with other signs of attraction, can be signals that she likes you. Of course, if you’re talking about her favorite sports team, it’s possible that she’s just engaged in the conversation and doesn’t actually have a crush on you. Are there any other signs of attraction also present?, Does she mess with her hair a lot? Adjust her clothing? Touch her face? Some of this could be nervousness, which may be an indication that she likes you and is feeling shy. This could also indicate that she wants to be sure she looks okay in front of you. Particularly look out for preening that seems out of character. If this girl rarely cares what her hair looks like (which may be common for tomboys) but is suddenly invested in smoothing out her ponytail all the time, that’s could be a clue that she wants to look nice for you.  Some studies have shown that if a person points their feet in your direction while you interact, they are attracted to or at least interested in you. If a person points their feet away from you, particularly in the direction of an escape route, it’s less likely that they’re attracted to you. One interaction won’t necessarily give you all of the information you need here. If her feet are pointed toward the end of the hall instead of toward you while you’re chatting at your lockers, it’s possible that she’s just in a hurry to get to class. Take some time and observe her feet in several interactions.  Does she ask you a lot of questions? Does she seem overly interested in what you did this weekend or what you had for breakfast? Though it’s possible that she’s just being polite, there’s a good chance that she’s just trying to keep talking to you for longer because she thinks you’re cute. , Are there lots of jokes that you two would make a cute couple? Have any of them asked you if you have a crush on her? Do they bring her name up to you a lot? It’s possible that she has confessed to some of her friends that she likes you, so listen up.Tomboys tend to have friends of all genders. Be sure to pay attention to each group of friends she hangs out with.  If this girl has been your friend for a while, you’ll probably notice when she’s acting differently all of a sudden. Ultimately, if you suspect that she has a crush on you, you’re probably right.  If she likes you, she’ll respond positively to some light flirting. Bring up an inside joke, “accidentally” touch her elbow with yours, laugh at her jokes, or just smile at her more than you usually would. If she reciprocates, she might have a crush on you.  If you’re on a sports team together or tend to join the same pick-up basketball game after school, this is a great time to get in some low-stakes flirting.  A single elbow bump at your lockers might not mean that she has a crush on you. But if she bumps elbows with you more than once, always angles her body toward you when you talk, laughs at even your dumbest jokes, AND seems worried about how her hair looks in front of you, then that all may add up to a crush! , When all else fails, if you really want to know if she likes you, it’s time to ask. Try to ask her in private, because you might feel embarrassed if you ask in front of others, and she might be too embarrassed to tell the truth.Beware that asking could put a strain on your friendship if she says no. That doesn’t necessarily mean that if she rejects you, you can’t be friends anymore. It just means that you will have to work extra hard to bring things back to normal.Take the risk if you’re pretty sure she likes you! If you like her too, the payoff of having your friend become your girlfriend would be worth it.  Particularly if this girl has been your friend for a long time, it’s possible that her attention to you is nothing more than a sign of friendship. If you have a crush on her, if you think she might also have one on you, and if you want to pursue it, give it a shot! Just beware that things could be a bit awkward between you if it doesn’t work out.","['In particular, see if there’s a change.', 'If you two used to hang out all the time alone, and she’s suddenly

Improve yourself by doing some of the following steps. , Do the things that you want to do and that interest you. Pursue your dreams. When you do this, you will find you pick up many attractive qualities, like passion, a strong work ethic, and a positive outlook.  A strong work ethic, determination, and passion are very attractive qualities. People like other people that get really into what they're doing and work hard. No matter what ignites your passion, throw yourself into your work to show others that you are not some lazy bum!, If you have bad habits or problems in your life, don't sweep them under the rug. Take the problem head on and fix it, before it drags down a relationship.  Your crush should love and accept you for who you are, so if you do make changes to yourself, be sure it is because you want those changes for your own happiness and not because they might make someone else happy.  Eat healthy and get exercise, because this will leave you feeling energetic and strong. When you feel good and comfortable in your own skin, this shows to other people and they will find you more attractive.  Keep your body clean by showering regularly and washing your hair and body. Wear deodorant and clean clothes as well. If you still find that you smell a bit off, try cleaning your room or changing what you eat.  In addition to keeping everything clean, you might want to try making yourself smell extra nice by wearing a little bit of cologne or perfume. Don't go over the top! Only a little bit is necessary. Try to wear a scent that you feel matches your personality.  Wear clothes that look nice and look nice on your body. This can be really different for different people. Don't wear anything too tight or too baggy, wear colors that compliment your natural skin tone and hair, and try to wear clothes that fit with the current trends. Look at fashion magazines or websites to get ideas.  Act confident to make yourself attractive in a totally different way. Most people are attracted to confidence, so either increase your confidence or fake it until no one notices the difference.  Don't hide in the corner....let your crush see the new you! Get out and do things and try not to blend into the furnishings so much. You don't even have to talk to them. Just be in the same room and see you interact with other people.You don't need to go out of your way to attract attention. Don't be loud and crazy. Be yourself.  Support them, like a friend should. This is an attractive quality, because it shows how much you care and how much you can add to their life. Listen to them rant about that teacher you both hate, watch one of their games, or surprise them by dropping in on their concerts. Say ""Hi!"" to your crush as you pass by them. If they aren't feeling well or are upset about something, help them out and comfort them as best as you can.  You don't need to spend time alone with them, but you do need to spend time together. You can hang out in groups and do things like watch movies or go to a great local music venue. Just give them the opportunity to start to get to know you.  Learn more about them and get to know them for who they really are, rather than just the basic facts that anyone could tell you. People like to feel a strong connection and that the person they're with really understands them as a whole, so if you know your crush well, they'll be more likely to take your feelings seriously.You can get to know them by talking about things that are important to them, like their hobbies, their life goals, their family, and their beliefs.  They should also get the chance to learn the same things about you. Be open to discussion and inviting. Don't try to compete with them when you discuss your life; just let them see you for who you are.  Find out what things you share in common, in order to help build a lasting foundation for a relationship. No matter how cute they are, if you have absolutely nothing in common, you're not going to have a very good time together. Find out what they're into and share your own interests with them.Relationships work best if both of you are geeky about the same thing. And believe us, everyone is geeky about something. Even if that something is football.  You don't necessarily have to enjoy what they are most passionate about, but it will help a lot if you can understand and follow along with what they love. Immerse yourself and give it time. And especially ask them for help: it's a great bonding experience.  People that are reluctant to get into relationships are usually reluctant because they worry about what that relationship will mean for their free time or who they are as a person. Show your crush that they don't need to worry about that with you by letting them be their own person. Don't be clingy. Encourage them to go out and do things they enjoy. And in the mean time, show your independence by spending time on your own and with your own friends.  Make sure your crush knows you're single and looking for someone to date. Mention it off-hand in a related conversation. However you do it, they need to know that you are in fact looking for someone to date.Ask them out for a movie or dinner, Tease them gently using a little bit of sarcasm or a wink and a nudge. Be playful, like poking them on the arm occasionally or punching them lightly on the arm or shoulder. This will begin to show them that you're interested in them.  Touching is a much more clear indicator of your feelings. Give them a light touch on the shoulder or the arm, always with a reason or excuse (out-of-context touching can be creepy). When you're a little closer, try touching their hand too.  Sometimes people just need things spelled out for them. Tell your crush that you like them but don't put any pressure on them to respond. They might need time to absorb the idea and examine their own feelings.  You can skip the previous step in favor of going straight for this one, or you can proceed to this one if they haven't done anything to respond to your previous confession.

Even though you aren't where they are, you can feel like you are through photos.Looking at the posts they like or share will also give you a better sense of their personalities, or at least how they want to be perceived by others.  Many social media sites now use algorithms that will determine what ends up on your timeline, wall, or page. This means that even if you are connected to your crush, that you may not see when they make new updates.

Prepare conversation topics. Introduce yourself. Ask for your crush's contact information. Get to know your crush's friends.,How to Watch Your Crush Without Being Noticed3,"If you've watched your crush and have gotten to know their personality, choose conversation topics that interest them. Think about the things they like such as their favorite show, a sport they enjoy, or a musician that they listen to. If you don't have any ideas, then ask them about themselves or talk about an event that's coming up in your town.You can also compliment your crush, but don't make it sexual.You can say something like, ""Hey, the noticed that you were listening to the new Drake album. I was thinking about picking it up. What do you think of it?"", Make eye contact with your crush and approach them with a smile. If you've never talked to them before, tell them your name and ask them for theirs. Even though you'll probably be nervous, make sure that you introduce yourself with confidence. Don't look away or mumble because it's a sign that you're insecure.To appear more confident make sure to speak clearly, keep a straight posture, and use your hands to gesture.Keep the conversation light and try to be humorous. Don't be overly serious or personal when you first approach your crush.  If you had a good conversation with your crush, it's important that you keep it going so you don't have to watch them without being noticed anymore. Ask for social media usernames or their cell phone number. See if they would want to hang out in the future or go on a date sometime.If the conversation went poorly, your crush may not want to give you their contact information. In this case remain respectful and back off.  If you feel overwhelmed and can't talk to your crush directly you can try to become friends with your crush's friends first. Try to find someone in their circle of friends that share mutual interests with you, and make it a point to talk to them or hang out with them socially. Once you feel like you are good enough friends, you can ask them to introduce you to their crush.When a mutual friend makes the introductions, it can relieve stress on both parties.Long term relationships are often started by introductions made by mutual friends.","[""If you've watched your crush and have gotten to know their personality, choose conversation topics that interest them."", 'Think about the things they like such as their favorite show, a sport they enjoy, or a musician that they listen to.', ""If you don't have any ideas, then ask them about themselves or talk about an event that's coming up in your town."", ""You can also compliment your crush, but don't make it sexual."", 'You can say something like, ""Hey, the noticed that you were listening to the new Drake album.', 'I was thinking about picking it up.', 'What do you think of it?', '"", Make eye contact with your crush and approach them with a smile.', ""If you've never talked to them before, tell them your name and ask them for theirs."", ""Even though you'll probably be nervous, make sure that you introduce yourself with confidence."", ""Don't look away or mumble because it's a sign that you're insecure."", 'To appear more confident make sure to speak clearly, keep a straight posture, and use your hands to gesture.', 'Keep the conversation light and try to be humorous.', ""Don't be overly serious or personal when you first approach your crush."", ""If you had a good conversation with your crush, it's important that you keep it going so you don't have to watch them without being noticed anymore."", 'Ask for social media usernames or their cell phone number.', 'See if they would want to hang out in the future or go on a date sometime.', 'If the conversation went poorly, your crush may not want to give you their contact information.', 'In this case remain respectful and back off.', ""If you feel overwhelmed and can't talk to your crush directly you can try to become friends with your crush's friends first."", 'Try to find someone in their circle of friends that share mutual interests with you, and make it a point to talk to them or hang out with them socially.', 'Once you feel like you are good enough friends, you can ask them to introduce you to their crush.', 'When a mutual friend makes the introductions, it can relieve stress on both parties.', 'Long term relationships are often started by introductions made by mutual friends.']"
"Pay attention to how often she starts the conversation.If initiating the conversation always falls on your shoulders, odds are, she is not very interested. See if she is usually the first to say goodbye. Count the emoticons. Determine how interested she is in what you have to say by her replies.If she has good, thorough responses to your comments, it shows a higher degree of interest in your thoughts and, by extension, a higher interest in you. Be encouraged if she starts to tease you.Texts like, ""You should be wishing you were here right now..."" or ""If you were here right now..."" are usually meant to tease you into wondering what the rest of the sentence would read, especially when they end with the ""..."" They are mildly suggestive without being too over the top, implying that she wants to get you to think about her and wonder about her feelings and intentions a little more. Note the content of her messages. Pay attention to punctuation. Look at how many of her words are unnecessarily long. Watch out for text giggles. Ask yourself if she frequently drops any hints.",How to Tell if a Girl Likes You over Text,"On the other hand, if she starts the conversation too often, she might not be interested, either. When a girl likes a guy, she will likely try to show her interest without being too obvious or looking too needy. As a result, she will start at least half of your conversations if not most, but probably won't start all of them. If a girl does start all of them, it could be a sign that she is not worried about seeming needy because she only sees you as a friend. , Even if the girl is tempted to hang on your every word, most girls will resist the urge. If anything, a girl who likes you is more likely to end a text conversation first in an effort to show that she is interesting and has an engaging social life even without you. When a girl ends most texting conversations with something like, ""Gotta go, I'm heading to movie with my bff,"" she could be interested. If, however, she just stops texting instead of saying good-bye, she is probably not interested.  A formal count is not necessary, of course, but make a mental note of how often she uses emoticons and which ones she uses most. The most often used emoticon a girl will flirt with is the winking face. The more often she uses an emoticon wink, the more likely it is that she has a thing for you. Standard smiles may or may not mean the same thing, but large smiles are another good sign. A blushing emoticon and a ""kiss face"" emoticon may also frequent her texts if she likes you, If she quickly turns the conversation to herself, she might not be interested. Similarly, if she gives super quick answers like ""K"" or frequently leaves the conversation with little more than a ""brb,"" she probably is not very interested. If she regularly jokes back with you when you say something funny, though, or asks you questions to keep the conversation, it demonstrates that she wants to keep talking to you for as long as possible. , If most of her texts are practical, such as question about assignments, then she may not be interested. On the other hand, if her texts are personal and ask about your personal life, she might be interested. This is especially true if she recalls specific details you previously mentioned to her about your plans. Another promising type of text is the random question. Look for something of no significance, like, ""Would you rather live on nothing but your least favorite food for a year or give up your favorite food for the rest of your life?"" These questions are fairly unimportant, and if she asks a bunch of them, it could be a sign that she is looking for an excuse to talk to you because you are on her mind.  Specifically, look at how often she uses exclamation points. More exclamation points indicates more excitement at the opportunity to talk to you, which could signify that she likes you. A ""Hey you!"" is infinitely more promising than a simple, ""Hey."", Not every girl does it, but many girls add extra vowels and consonants onto words. For instance, she might text words like ""heyyyy,"" ""riiiiiight,"" ""pleeeeeaaassseee,"" ""hiiiiii"" or ""byyyyeee."" The idea is to mimic the elongation of words often used in real-life flirtatious banter.  Any text laughter is a good sign, but there are some that are better signs than others. Standard abbreviations like ""LOL,"" ""ROTFL,"" or ""LMAO"" can be sent to just about anyone, friend or crush alike. A ""haha"" is a better sign, because she wants you to actually imagine her laughing. A ""hehe"" or ""teehee"" is even better. These two forms of text laughing are the equivalent of a real-life giggle, rather than a loud laugh, and a girl is more likely to text you a ""giggle"" if she wants to sound cute.  A common hint dropped via text is the invitation to meet in person. An actual invite to a party is good, but an even better invitation is the random “on the fly” sort, in which she casually mentions something like, “I think I’ll head to the pool. Meet me there?” These messages may seem casual, but in actuality, they usually indicate that she wants to see you and only you, and now.

Watch his actions to see if he treats you differently from the rest of your group. Watch for him showing a sudden, previously unexpressed interest in things that you like and do. Check for signs of nervousness. Pay attention to his friends. Look to see if he imitates you. Pay attention to gentle, friendly teasing. If he hits you or playfully punches you on your arm, this may mean he likes you. Acknowledge any compliments that come your way. Watch for him noticing 'masculine things' on you. If he chats to you often on a social networking site, it may mean that he likes you. Watch to see if he has suddenly developed a habit of turning up where you happen to be. Be receptive to his signals.",How to Know if a Guy Likes You,"Body language can be the ""big tell"" when it comes to discerning if that guy fancies you enough to date you. Interestingly, body language experts believe that while females have around 52 body language tells to show a guy that they're interested, guys show around only 10.If you subscribe to this theory, this should make your guessing a little easier! All the same, you still need to know what to look for, as well as being sure that you're not mistaking innocent gestures for calls of love––the latter mistake could prove embarrassing. Some of the signs of body language to watch for include:He looks at you a lot. His eyebrow may even lift as he watches you (""the eyebrow flash"" that lasts a fifth of a second). He might not even be really conscious he is watching you as much as he is.Notice how much he looks at your face and makes eye contact.He leans towards you a lot. Personal space invasion is a sign of major interest.Check the direction of his hands, feet, legs, toes, etc. If they're pointed toward you, it's a subconscious indicator of his interest in you.He starts grooming himself. He pulls at his tie to straighten it or he readjusts the fit of his sweater. Perhaps he runs his hands through his hair in attempt to tidy it or he reaches down to tie his shoelaces. Doing this repeatedly is similar to the actions of a male bird preening up his feathers for a display!Check out how he's sitting. If you see rather manly gestures, such as sitting with open legs or placing his hands on his hips, he's trying to impress.If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. If he slouches his shoulders when near you, he's romantic and cares about what you have to say. If he points his shoulders and pelvis towards you while sitting, he is definitely feeling something for you. , As already noted, a guy who is interested in you will look at you a lot, even if covertly. He may try to catch your eye or, if he's shy, he may suddenly turn his head away if you catch him checking you out. To test his interest, scan his face for four seconds, then look away (don't look any longer or it becomes awkward). Then look back––if he maintains or increases eye contact with you, he's interested. If his eyes wander to your mouth, he's definitely interested. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. On the other hand, if he breaks eye contact with you and starts looking around the room, he's not interested in you.A gaze that has him looking left, then sweeping over your face, then looking right is a sign he's very attracted to you.Be careful not to confuse a shy guy's darting retreat from eye contact with a guy who is clearly disinterested. A shy guy who is interested will continue to steal glances at you. Be patient!If you don't like the guy, it can be uncomfortable to maintain eye contact; break it off quickly and scan the room yourself, as if looking for someone else.When he's around you and he says or does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed too––this means he's keen to make a good impression on you.His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.  If he likes you, and he's nervous or anticipating the chance to get closer to you, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves, especially if you talk about another guy in his company.Gauge his interest in what you have to say. It really doesn't matter what you say, it's how you say it that can tell you a lot about his level of interest. So, try this: Lean in and whisper, with your shoulder barely touching his and say something softly. To heighten the impact, steady yourself gently by brushing your arm across his back. If he moves his head closer toward you and either touches you back or maintains eye contact, he's interested in you. If he isn't interested, he'll probably step back or be very unresponsive. A really disinterested guy might even try to shoo you out of his personal space!, Touch is an important sign of interest in a developing relationship and you can assess interest both by observing how he touches you and how he reacts to you touching him. If he's keen on you, he might put his hand on yours when he laughs, he might gently brush his leg against yours but won't move it away again, or he may hug you for small things, such as greeting you, expressing emotions when telling a story or just because you ""look like you need a hug."" On the other hand, consider touching him to see what happens––a gentle brush of your hand against his neck, a hold of his forearm with your hand, or running your fingers across his hand after joking with him about something. He's interested in you if he responds to it and doesn't flinch away or if he moves his hand to stay on yours or on your arm or leg. On the other hand, if he tenses up or moves his hand away, he's not interested.If he is a shy guy, he may jump a little because he wasn't prepared for you to touch him. That doesn't necessarily mean that he doesn't like you, watch his actions carefully afterwards.Obviously, playboy guys (bad boys) might be very keen to spread their touching gestures around; be sure that he has more substance than this by observing how he interacts with other women in your group.See if he uses any of the tricks in How to touch a girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else.  If he's really interested in you, he may start to behave protectively toward you, or in a ""gentlemanly"" fashion (at least to the extent that he interprets his behavior as such). Look for signs like shifting his chair closer to yours, putting his arm around the back of your chair, leaving his jacket on the back of your chair or even going so far as to place the jacket around you to ward off your complaints of being cold.Be aware that some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives him a chance to see your reaction, and helps him know if you really do like him or not. (Yes, it's an odd sort of logic, especially since you might end up so offended or confused that you just give up on him!) However, you can usually spot a ""get-your-attention"" flirt if, in the middle of his flirting scenario, he keeps taking the chance to look at you, seeking out your response. You can also try a quick trip to the bathroom and find yourself a sneaky observation point to check out how the flirting is proceeding. If he stops the moment you've left, it's you he's serious about, not her. Alternatively, ask a friend to do some observing for you while you're away.  For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he doesn't know as well, he may ask you to suggest bands or artists for him to listen to. Or, he may have gone to the trouble of finding out that a favorite band of yours is playing next weekend and mention to this, with or without a request to go and listen together. And, if you introduce him to a TV show that he didn't really know about and that becomes his new favorite thing, that can potentially be a sign that he likes you, especially if he goes out of his way to catch up with you to discuss the show's unfolding plot.  Signs of nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, or possibly even looking away quickly when you notice he is watching you, can all be signs of an attraction towards you. If he is nervous about making an impression on you, it means he's trying hard and you are probably very close to being able to start making moves.  If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence––do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?Be careful if a friend of his makes suggestions that a guy likes you but all of the other indications tell you otherwise. Sometimes friends have reasons of their own for ensuring that any chances of you getting together are ruined, including catapulting you into making a fool of yourself.  Mirroring each other's actions is a sign of mutual like and generally, it's subconscious. If you notice that he has been copying your gestures frequently, there is a high probability that he fancies you. You can test this by mirroring his actions too, for example, touch your hair when he touches his, brush your face when he brushes his, sit the way he is sitting, etc. The subconscious signals will be screaming ""I like you too!""Following you can be another sign; for example, if you buy lunch and sit at a table and he edges as near to, or even on the same, table as you, he is probably trying to get closer to you. Just be sure you're not confusing this action with there being a lack of space to sit anywhere else!, If a guy teases you in a friendly and fun manner, it could indicate his interest, especially if he's young. Provided this isn't his modus operandi with every girl he flirts with, it's a sign that he's singled you out for attention and is trying to use his wit to charm you, in that awkward way of using humor to cover up true intentions. Of course, if he says something unkind or unfortunate, don't feel you have to excuse it––point it out if he offends you; it's best he knows now that you won't take nonsense than to discover it later.Some guys make fun of their crushes in a slightly mean way. If this goes too far, he may need a reminder to act more mature.  A guy may gently hit or punch you on the arm as a covert, ""manly"" way of getting to touch you without making it too obvious what his intention is. If he finds that you don't pull away too much when he does this, he might find the courage to proceed to more gentle ways of touching you. Of course, this doesn't mean you need to sit there in pain if he actually hurts you––be assertive enough to point out that it hurt! You can salve his pride by saying something about not minding him touching you but to please watch out for your sensitive bony bits! And if you're the kind of girl who finds the play punching a bit of fun, give him a playful knock right back.Play punching can send mixed signals. It could mean ""I treat you like one of the boys"" and signal friendzone antics only. Check out whether he does this to other girls in your mutual group. Moreover, if he continues to think that play punching you is a fun way to hang out, you might be dealing with someone who is never going to get past this immature display of affection; don't let it go on indefinitely.If you don't like it, say so immediately. You are entitled to ask someone not to harm you, even if the gesture is well intentioned.  If you do your hair or makeup differently one day, and the guy notices, that's a very good sign that he likes you. Most guys won't notice, or if they do, they won't be bothered to say anything unless they're totally into you. Anything like, ""You look nice today,"" ""I like that shirt,"" or even ""Did you do your hair differently today? It looks nice,"" are all indicators that he could be interested in you.Note: If this guy is a good friend of yours, compliments won't necessarily be indicators of romantic interest. It could just be him being a truly good friend.Not all guys are this straightforward about compliments, so don't be worried if he doesn't compliment you.  For example, some of your dad's aftershave rubbed off on you when you hugged him. Your crush may say ""is that aftershave on you?"" Noticing this can indicate that he thinks the scent comes from another guy (and not your dad!), revealing some vulnerability about losing you out to someone else. This could also apply to having, carrying or wearing things that he might think belong to another guy.  After all, when online there are many things competing for his time, like games, connecting with mates and checking out sites that might not be so interesting to you… Of course, he could also just be talkative, friendly, or even bored, so don't assume he's into you just for chatting––this should be treated as one extra indicator along with some of the others outlined above.If he puts an 'x' sign on the end of everything he says to you, don't assume it means he likes you. It could just mean that he perceives you both as good friends or that he's just used to ending his chats that way.If he says, ""I know something you don't know,"" then this could mean that he likes you and is playing a little guessing game. Or it could just mean he's doing the usual social media thing of spreading information for fun, like the discovery of a new planet or finding the cure to cancer, etc. Use the context to judge the import of any such online personal game playing.  If he suddenly seems to be in certain places at certain times of the day where you wouldn't necessarily expect to see him, it may be that he's taken to deliberately ""finding"" opportunities to bump into you. If it happens a lot in a short space of time, it's probably no coincidence but a concerted effort to catch up with you as much as possible.  If he shows genuine interest in you, (for example, he smiles at you a lot whenever the two of you pass each other or he goes out of his way to say hello to you), be friendly and polite back. If you've already decided that he's someone you'd like to date, don't let it go too long before facilitating an opportunity for the two of you to get together to talk in a quiet place. On the other hand, if he's not your type or you've changed your mind about flirting any further, be honest and let him know that you're flattered but you're not available.","['Body language can be the ""big tell"" when it comes to discerning if that guy fancies you enough to date you.', ""Interestingly, body language experts believe that while females have around 52 body language tells to show a guy that they're interested, guys show around only 10.If you subscribe to this theory, this should make your guessing a little easier!"", ""All the same, you still need to know what to look for, as well as being sure that you're not mistaking innocent gestures for calls of love––the latter mistake could prove embarrassing."", 'Some of the signs of body language to watch for include:He looks at you a lot.', 'His eyebrow may even lift as he watches you (""the eyebrow flash"" that lasts a fifth of a second).', 'He might not even be really conscious he is watching you as much as he is.', 'Notice how much he looks at your face and makes eye contact.', 'He leans towards you a lot.', 'Personal space invasion is a sign of major interest.', 'Check the direction of his hands, feet, legs, toes, etc.', ""If they're pointed toward you, it's a subconscious indicator of his interest in you."", 'He starts grooming himself.', 'He pulls at his tie to straighten it or he readjusts the fit of his sweater.', 'Perhaps he runs his hands through his hair in attempt to tidy it or he reaches down to tie his shoelaces.', ""Doing this repeatedly is similar to the actions of a male bird preening up his feathers for a display!Check out how he's sitting."", ""If you see rather manly gestures, such as sitting with open legs or placing his hands on his hips, he's trying to impress."", 'If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot.', ""If he slouches his shoulders when near you, he's romantic and cares about what you have to say."", 'If he points his shoulders and pelvis towards you while sitting, he is definitely feeling something for you.', ', As already noted, a guy who is interested in you will look at you a lot, even if covertly.', ""He may try to catch your eye or, if he's shy, he may suddenly turn his head away if you catch him checking you out."", ""To test his interest, scan his face for four seconds, then look away (don't look any longer or it becomes awkward)."", ""Then look back––if he maintains or increases eye contact with you, he's interested."", ""If his eyes wander to your mouth, he's definitely interested."", 'If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there.', ""On the other hand, if he breaks eye contact with you and starts looking around the room, he's not interested in you."", ""A gaze that has him looking left, then sweeping over your face, then looking right is a sign he's very attracted to you."", ""Be careful not to confuse a shy guy's darting retreat from eye contact with a guy who is clearly disinterested."", 'A shy guy who is interested will continue to steal glances at you.', ""Be patient!If you don't like the guy, it can be uncomfortable to maintain eye contact;

You can flirt with her by smiling a lot, tickling her softly (though some girls may not like to be tickled), complimenting her, telling her it was fun being with her or winking at her (many girls think it's really sexy when a boy winks at them, so give it a try!). You can also flirt in your own ways, as long as you don't do something that she doesn't like. Groping inappropriately will make a very bad impression.  If the two of you have been hanging out for a week or so, and you feel like she might be into you, don't be afraid to ask her out. Have faith in yourself, and think of how much it's worth it to ask because if she agrees, you will have plenty of fun.  Take a walk with her at sunset on the beach. That would be the perfect place to try to kiss her.  Most girls prefer a private romantic kiss. This doesn't mean you take her to your room in your bed. Take her to a quiet, romantic looking place and she'll most probably get the message that you want a kiss. But if she doesn't want to come to a private place with you, that either means that she's not ready to kiss you, it's her first time, she feels uncomfortable with you or she's just nervous or shy. Don't force it when she's ready you will know.  Don't hurt her feelings though, tease her in a joking and funny manner, and make sure that she knows that you're just joking. Never tease her by making fun of her. , If she tries to come closer to you, it can signal that she's into you. If she just smiles and/or blushes, it may mean that she likes you but she's shy.  Nothing is worse than telling a girl she's beautiful when she knows it's not true. Try complimenting her on specific things, like how pretty her hair is, or how soft her hand feels in yours.  If she tries to come closer to you, holds your hand and squeezes it gently, smiles a lot, looks at you most of the time, snuggles to you, hugs you, pecks your cheek, then it means that she likes you and she's happy to be with you and she was really looking forward to going out with you. (If she doesn't pay much attention to you, you could make her jealous by flirting with another girl in front of her. Be cautious with this.)","['Girls love it when boys have confidence.', 'To act confident, you have to believe in yourself.', 'However, do not be cocky.', 'Girls almost always fall for romantic guys.', 'Girls love funny guys!', ""But don't say disgusting things that you think are funny, as that will only gross her out."", ""For instance, tell her that you are willing to help her with her homework (If she asks you to help her with homework) rather than going to your friend's party."", ""Dress in cool clothes and wear some nice cologne or something, but don't go overboard."", ', If she looks back at you, then the answer might be positive!', ""But don't just keep staring at each other for an hour with nothing else to do."", 'If someone speaks poorly of her, even if not seriously, do not tolerate this.', 'Most girls like flirty guys.', ""But don't overdo it."", ""You can flirt with her by smiling a lot, tickling her softly (though some girls may not like to be tickled), complimenting her, telling her it was fun being with her or winking at her (many girls think it's really sexy when a boy winks at them, so give it a try!)."", ""You can also flirt in your own ways, as long as you don't do something that she doesn't like."", 'Groping inappropriately will make a very bad impression.', ""If the two of you have been hanging out for a week or so, and you feel like she might be into you, don't be afraid to ask her out."", ""Have faith in yourself, and think of how much it's worth it to ask because if she agrees, you will have plenty of fun."", 'Take a walk with her at sunset on the beach.', 'That would be the perfect place to try to kiss her.', 'Most girls prefer a private romantic kiss.', ""This doesn't mean you take her to your room in your bed."", ""Take her to a quiet, romantic looking place and she'll most probably get the message that you want a kiss."", ""But if she doesn't want to come to a private place with you, that either means that she's not ready to kiss you, it's her first time, she feels uncomfortable with you or she's just nervous or shy."", ""Don't force it when she's ready you will know."", ""Don't hurt her feelings though, tease her in a joking and funny manner, and make sure that she knows that you're just joking."", 'Never tease her by making fun of her.', "", If she tries to come closer to you, it can signal that she's into you."", 'If she just smiles and/or blushes, it may mean that she likes you', ""but she's shy."", ""Nothing is worse than telling a girl she's beautiful when she knows it's not true."", 'Try complimenting her on specific things, like how pretty her hair is, or how soft her hand feels in yours.', 'If she tries to come closer to you, holds your hand and squeezes it gently, smiles a lot, looks at you most of the time, snuggles to you, hugs you, pecks your cheek, then it means that she likes you', ""and she's happy to be with you"", 'and she was really looking forward to going out with you.', ""(If she doesn't pay much attention to you, you could make her jealous by flirting with another girl in front of her."", 'Be cautious with this.)']"
"Wow him. Don't cake on the makeup. Start up a conversation. Tease him. Break the touch barrier but always remember to respect people's personal space. Get close to his friends. Find out things about him. Support him. Study together. Test him. Make sure the coast is clear. Don't give up. Balance out your life. Be yourself. If you think that he might like you, try to be a little more forward with him. Send him a love letter.",How to Get a Boy in Middle School to Like You,"If you want that special guy to start noticing you, you're going to have to put yourself out there. It's hard, but it's worth it. Look your best, work that smile, be friendly, and be yourself—he'll start wishing he knew you in no time.Dress to impress. If you're that kind of girl, wear a floral dress when it's hot out, or a cute black sweater when it's cold. Wear clothes that accent your features. Get a friend's advice on what looks good on you, or ask your parents. You want him to notice how well dressed you are every time he sees you. Don't dress in something you will not feel comfortable in. Dress the way you want to but, make sure that you at least look cute. If your school has a uniform wear a color or style that looks good on you.Be clean and have good hygiene. Shower at least once a day. For example, if you practice on a soccer team or exert yourself after school, be sure to shower afterwards to get all that sweat off of you. Wash your face in the morning and at night; you don't want pimples to attack your pretty face. Also, don't forget to brush your teeth! You only get one set of adult teeth. Look after them because bad breath can really push him away, and everyone else, too.Smile. Smile when you talk to him, or when he's around. Smiling lets him know that he makes you happy. Glance at him during class, if you happen to lock eyes, smile, and hold his gaze without blinking for as long as possible. Let him digest the fact that you're thinking about him, and then look away like nothing has ever happened. Don't overdo it, though—that shouldn't be done more than once a day. , It's not really necessary, and lots of guys like natural anyway, so go for a natural look when it comes to makeup. If you feel like you have to use makeup, be subtle with it. Don't go overboard because that will make him not like you.Wear minimal makeup. Makeup is not for covering up your best features but making them pop. Consider going for the natural look, too. Some guys just want to see your face not your makeup! Too much makeup can lead to teasing and not the flirty type! If you really want to wear makeup, just use some lip balm, foundation, and even mascara if you like. If you wear makeup keep it simple because cake faces are a real turn off.Play around with your hairstyle. Be yourself, don't ever decide how you want your hair to look just for some boy. Consider trimming your bangs, straightening, or curling your hair if you think it suits you. Alternatively, play with wearing your hair or makeup in a different way one day.  Act casual, but be yourself. If you're having trouble, pretend like you don't have a crush on him and that he's just another person. That gets rid of the tension that can make a conversation awkward. Practice on other boys like his friends. Get his number so you can text, which is a lot easier.Talk about friends in your class, something strange that happened to you, or a social event you both plan on attending. If you're having trouble keeping the conversation going, be sure to ask him lots of questions. Not so much because he might get annoyed.Make good eye contact with him throughout. Your eyes are the window into your soul, and definitely one of the most attractive parts of your body. Make sure he sees them! Focusing your eyes on him will tell him he's got your undivided attention. But don't stare at him all the time, this will make him think you're creepy. Look into his eyes when he talks to you; if you look at his feet, you don't look confident.Laugh at his jokes. Doing so will make him feel appreciated. That being said, don't force yourself to laugh because it will sound fake. If it's a joke indicated at you, make a subtle one back at him. It's all playful.  Don't make fun of him, but joking around is okay. Play around with him, and if you want to get flirty, ask him to arm wrestle you. That way, you could hold his hand and it won't seem weird or awkward.  Some people don't like being touched as much as others. Making physical contact with your crush is important because it tells him you like getting close to him. Subtle is best here: you don't want to claw at him and invade his personal space. Give him hugs when you see him.Gently touch his arm or bump your knee against his. Rub shoulders with him when you ask him to explain that science problem you both had for homework. School related work is the best to get in-touch with someone, it's a perfect excuse.When he tells a funny joke or teases you (in a flirty way), lightly hit him on the shoulder. Your body language is telling him that you actually enjoy his attention.If you're really brave, let your hand crawl up his arm onto his shoulder or play footsie with him, you can also sit on his desk before class starts. Also blow him kisses in a playful way.Tickling is also a great way of flirting. Because a lot of guys don't like being tickled, however, you would be better off at the receiving end. Mention being ticklish and make your ticklish spots vulnerable. It's good to start with a spot like your feet and build up to being touched on the ribs and sides. You would let him tickle you.Play with his hair. Don't over-do it, though, or it will look strange, and he will want to stay away from you.  Boys his age are easily influenced by their friends, so if you're friends with his friends, he'll realize that you're ""cool."" If you're part of the same group, the two of you can hang out more often without feeling awkward. Make sure you don't become ""one of the bros"" because boys don't date their best friends.If you feel uncomfortable around his friends, that's fine. Don't avoid them or leave when you see them coming.Use your siblings. If both your siblings are close in age, you automatically have something to talk about! Even better, if his siblings and your siblings are friends, suggest that the two of you take your siblings to the movies or amusement park together.  Talk to him about his interests, his family, music tastes, etc. Find out if any of his interests and your interests overlap.Don't forget to actually listen! Bring up details he said later on in conversation to prove that you're a good listener. (Don't overdo this or you'll seem like a stalker.)Try to find things you have in common. Do you both play guitar or love the same bands? Suggest that you jam together! Do you both play sports? Ask him to play a pickup game sometime.  It may take a bit of practice to know what makes him click, but stick with it. Take the things that he likes to do and be sure to make an appearance.Does he do sports? Go to his games or tournaments and cheer him on. Ask him when it's going to be, and wish him luck if you can't come. See if he tries to spot you in the stands!Encourage him when he is down: All guys have some down moments, so cheer him up. Showing him that you care will make him more likely to care about you.Do not say another boy is ""hot"" or go on about someone else. He might think you like the other boy and not him. If you like multiple boys at the same time, decide on which boy which you want to pursue and only go after him. Or, have a lot of friends and don't focus on one boy! It's not like you are going to get married! It's fun to have a lot of friends and not have to worry about treating anyone one of them differently because you don't like them all the same. If your crush finds out that you like two guys at the same time, he might not feel that he was special in your mind.  If there's a subject you excel at and he's struggling with, offer to help him. If the opposite is true, ask him for help. This will lead to more one-on-one time and an overall better relationship with him.You probably already know this, but don't plan on getting a lot of work done during these study sessions. Your attention is going to be spent elsewhere, and that's okay! Just prepare for your exam a day or two ahead if you can.  There are a couple different ways for you to tell whether a boy likes you or not. Here are some tricks to find out without coming out and asking him.Ask him to carry your backpack to class. Tell him it's heavy and he looks strong enough to carry it easily. If he says yes, it probably means that he likes you enough to do favors for you, and likes that you think he's strong.If you want to tell one of your friends something when he's there, tell him to close his ears or to step back a little. This will make him want to hear what's going on even more, and you'll know that he cares.  Be sure he does not already have a girlfriend. Double check to make sure that none of your friends like him. You don't want to stir up a lot of drama with your friends, because you might lose a friend and scare your crush away.If one of your friends does like him, you should discuss who ""gets"" him. If you can't come to a fair agreement (such as who liked him first, he chooses, etc.), both of you should move on.If you decide to let your friend go after him and they get together, don't hold it against her. Stay friends with her. Be happy for them and realize that there will be plenty of other boys in your future.  If you don't get the person you like, don't get sad. Be confident in who you are deep down inside and love yourself from the inside out.Sometimes, after a boy realizes you like them that way, they start to see you in a different light. Even if he says no, he may start to subconsciously think about the characteristics that he likes about you or why you would make a good girlfriend.Shy boys don't always have the courage to tell other people how they really feel, or they don't know how to. If you like a shy boy and he doesn't seem interested, it could be because he gets nervous around you and doesn't know what to do. If he is shy, keep trying to make him feel comfortable around you. Definitely hang out with him in places where he is most comfortable.  It's definitely tough being a middle-schooler, but you're beginning to learn how to balance out all the work and drama in your life. Don't be too over-committed or you won't have time to hang out with him and remember that there's more to life than middle school and it won't be long before you're not even sure what you ever saw in that boy!If he feels he can't keep up with you, he might get too nervous and think that you're out of his league. If you are very socially active, invite him to come along one day with you and some of your friends. This will give him a chance to be around you outside of school and in your natural state. Don't make him feel like you're never around. If you bring him along make sure he feels comfortable.Likewise, don't under-commit or you could seem like a loser. You want to surround your life with interesting activities and friends regardless of whether he likes you. If he does like you, your life just got that much better. If he doesn't like you, your life is fun and meaningful without him!, This means being comfortable in your own skin, doing what you want to do, and saying what you want to say. The people who don't love and respect you for who you are truly aren't worth fighting for.Don't try to be somebody you're not. He'll like you just the way you are. You may even have some things in common.  Let him know you're interested, but not desperate. If you're not sure where he's at, be careful about following these steps; they might not turn out the way you had hoped!Ask him, ""Hey, would you like to hang out with me sometime?"". If he says yes, you've done your part. Smile and tell him you have to go. Then walk away without looking back. Now the ball is in his court.Suggest going to the movies or a school sports game together. Asking him to the movies would be a little more formal of a date, but you could also suggest going with friends. Asking him to a school sports game doesn't have to be a ""date."" It could just be you two hanging out.Ask him out to Sadie Hawkins dance, if these are ever held where you live. Sadie Hawkins is when the girls ask the boys out for a dance. Pile up your courage and ask him whether he'd want to be your date. If he says yes, he definitely likes you.  If this still isn't impressing him try some love letters. Make a cute flirty playful letter from a secret admirer and leave it in his locker. Leave a secret code word like ""flower"" at the end of every note saying if he finds out who you are to say this word to him. After the first week start dropping hints that it's you by writing about things in the letter that he likes and then talking to him about them. Once he sees your common interests he is sure to give you a chance.Don't write anything that you would be embarrassed about if anyone else read it. Letters can get misplaced. If someone else finds your letter, you could both be in for some teasing!","[""If you want that special guy to start noticing you, you're going to have to put yourself out there."", ""It's hard, but

"Brainstorm. Focus on the energy over the specific message. Think about the past, present, and future. State your intent first.",How to Write a Love Letter to a Girl You Do Not Know2,"Before you begin writing a love letter, you should spend some time brainstorming. This means gathering your thoughts so you can better express yourself when writing the physical letter. To start, ask yourself some questions.Who are you writing the letter to? Think about how you know this girl. Is she someone you admire from school who you've never spoken to? Is she a barista at a local coffee shop who you admire but are unsure how to approach?What do you like about this person? As you begin thinking about the letter's recipient, think about why you're infatuated with her. What about her do you admire and why? Go beyond mere physical beauty. For example, if you're writing about a barista you have a crush on you might admire her hairstyle and eyes. However, try to push beyond this. What about her personality is intriguing to you? Is she always particularly polite with customers? Does she always smile at people, even if they don't smile back?Can you think of any specific incidents? People are attracted to people who notice them. If you can think of a specific moment when you realized you had feelings for this person, that would be great to include in the letter. Try to jog your memory and think of a specific moment when you began to develop romantic feelings.  It can be hard to write to someone you do not know. Even if you admire this person very much, you will not have as much information at your disposal as you would writing to someone you have an existing relationship with. Therefore, focus on the energy over the message. Even if your feelings are vague, the fact you wrote a letter at all speaks volumes.Writing someone a love letter takes courage and commitment. You have to sit down and physically write out your feelings. Delivering the letter carries a risk of rejection, especially if the recipient is very much a stranger to you. Therefore, the effort you took to write the letter in and of itself may be seen as impressive by the recipient.Remember your intention if you feel nervous or frustrated when writing the letter. You want to let this stranger know you admire her. The energy behind that intention is more important than finding the perfect words and phrases. Allow your intent to guide you as you begin to express your feelings.  If you're still struggling to think of ideas, focus on the past, present, and future. This can get your creative juices flowing. When did you meet this person? What is your relationship now? What do you hope for in the future? Some details may be inexact when writing a love letter to a stranger but you may find some inspiration considering these factors.When did you first notice this person? Did she sit ahead of you in algebra class and you noticed the smell of her conditioner? Did you order a latte from her when you were having a bad day and notice she drew a smiley face on the side of your cup? While your meeting may have been brief, and while she may not remember, you might have noticed something you can include in your letter.How does this person affect you now? While you may not have a relationship in the present, you may still gain something valuable from day-to-day interactions with this person. For example, maybe it's nice to see her through the window as you pass by your local Starbucks. Maybe it's nice to overhear the music she's listening to before the bell rings for class.Finally, think of the future. Where do you want to go from here? Maybe you just wanted to express your feelings rather than bottling them up. However, maybe you're hoping you could meet this person and the two of you could get to know each other. Think about what you want from this letter when considering the future.  When you feel ready to write the letter, begin by stating your intent. This can be brief, as short as a single sentence. However, it's an important sentence. You want the recipient to know this is a letter expressing some deep feelings so she'll pay attention to its content. For example, you could say something like, ""We don't know each other, but I'm writing to tell you I've admired you for quite some time. We have an algebra class together in a lecture hall on campus, and I think your taste in music is amazing.""","['Before you begin writing a love letter, you should spend some time brainstorming.', 'This means gathering your thoughts so you can better express yourself when writing the physical letter.', 'To start, ask yourself some questions.', 'Who are you writing the letter to?', 'Think about how you know this girl.', ""Is she someone you admire from school who you've never spoken to?"", 'Is she a barista at a local coffee shop who you admire but are unsure how to approach?What do you like about this person?', ""As you begin thinking about the letter's recipient, think about why you're infatuated with her."", 'What about her do you admire and why?', 'Go beyond mere physical beauty.', ""For example, if you're writing about a barista you have a crush on you might admire her hairstyle and eyes."", 'However, try to push beyond this.', 'What about her personality is intriguing to you?', 'Is she always particularly polite with customers?', ""Does she always smile at people, even if they don't smile back?Can you think of any specific incidents?"", 'People are attracted to people who notice them.', 'If you can think of a specific moment when you realized you had feelings for this person, that would be great to include in the letter.', 'Try to jog your memory and think of a specific moment when you began to develop romantic feelings.', 'It can be hard to write to someone you do not know.', 'Even if you admire this person very much, you will not have as much information at your disposal as you would writing to someone you have an existing relationship with.', 'Therefore, focus on the energy over the message.', 'Even if your feelings are vague, the fact you wrote a letter at all speaks volumes.', 'Writing someone a love letter takes courage and commitment.', 'You have to sit down and physically write out your feelings.', 'Delivering the letter carries a risk of rejection, especially if the recipient is very much a stranger to you.', 'Therefore, the effort you took to write the letter in and of itself may be seen as impressive by the recipient.', 'Remember your intention if you feel nervous or frustrated when writing the letter.', 'You want to let this stranger know you admire her.', 'The energy behind that intention is more important than finding the perfect words and phrases.', 'Allow your intent to guide you as you begin to express your feelings.', ""If you're still struggling to think of ideas, focus on the past, present, and future."", 'This can get your creative juices flowing.', 'When did you meet this person?', 'What is your relationship now?', 'What do you hope for in the future?', 'Some details may be inexact when writing a love letter to a stranger but you may find some inspiration considering these factors.', 'When did you first notice this person?', 'Did she sit ahead of you in algebra class and you noticed the smell of her conditioner?', 'Did you order a latte from her when you were having a bad day and notice she drew a smiley face on the side of your cup?', 'While your meeting may have been brief, and while she may not remember, you might have noticed something you can include in your letter.', 'How does this person affect you now?', 'While you may not have a relationship in the present, you may still gain something valuable from day-to-day interactions with this person.', ""For example, maybe it's nice to see her through the window as you pass by your local Starbucks."", ""Maybe it's nice to overhear the music she's listening to before the bell rings for class."", 'Finally, think of the future.', 'Where do you want to go from here?', 'Maybe you just wanted to express your feelings rather than bottling them up.', ""However, maybe you're hoping you could meet this person and the two of you could get to know each other."", 'Think about what you want from this letter when considering the future.', 'When you feel ready to write the letter, begin by stating your intent.', 'This can be brief, as short as a single sentence.', ""However, it's an important sentence."", ""You want the recipient to know this is a letter expressing some deep feelings so she'll pay attention to its content."", 'For example, you could say something like, ""We don\'t know each other, but I\'m writing to tell you I\'ve admired you for quite some time.', 'We have an algebra class together in a lecture hall on campus, and I think your taste in music is amazing.""']"
State exactly how you feel. Focus on the recipient. Use your own voice. Say how this person has affected you.,How to Write a Love Letter to a Girl You Do Not Know3,"As you move forward in the letter, be upfront about your feelings. A love letter is not the place to be shy. Tell the girl why you admire her and what qualities about her most intrigue you. Go into specifics when possible. You may not know a lot about this person, but mention small things about her that you love. For example, maybe you think the buttons she has on her purse are hilarious. Maybe you notice she listens to a particular band on her headphones that you also enjoy.Be upfront about why you've never approached her in person. While many people enjoy anonymous love letters, there is always the risk of coming off the wrong way. You don't want the recipient to feel like she's being watched. It can help if you assure her, at some point, you're a relatively normal person who happens to feel more comfortable expressing feelings in writing.There are a variety of reasons you may prefer writing a love letter. You could be shy, for example, and find expressing yourself easier in words. Maybe you only see her when she's at work and don't want to bother her. Whatever you reason, make sure you state it early on. You want to make sure the recipient understands why you chose a letter over simply talking to her. This way, you can help avoid potential confusion or discomfort.Returning to the example of the girl you know in algebra class, you may hesitate to approach her because you're shy. You could write something like, ""I always want to talk to you in person. However, I'm very shy by nature. Now that we're halfway through the semester, I'm worried I'll never get the courage together. So, I decided to write you a letter."", Oftentimes, people end up inadvertently talking about themselves in a love letter. While you should certainly talk about your own feelings, make sure to focus primarily on the recipient. As you write the letter, express what you like about this person. If you admire that she's always listening to Elliot Smith on her headphones, say so. However, do not go on a 3 paragraph anecdote about your own admiration for Smith.Use specifics when possible. If you're writing to a relative stranger, specifics may be hard. However, small things go a long way. Do you love the coconut-like smell of her shampoo? Do you enjoy how she laughs to herself during downtime at the coffee shop? Do you remember a comment she made in class that was particularly insightful?Let's return to the algebra class example. You could write something like, ""I notice you're always listening to Elliot Smith. I am a big fan of his as well. I'm impressed by how drawn in you seem to the music. You seem to have an intense appreciation for art."", You don't have to write in a lofty, elevated style if it doesn't come naturally to you. The primary purpose of a love letter is to express your feelings in a way that makes the recipient feel good about herself. The best way to do this is to simply be yourself and use your own words. This will sound more authentic and sincere when expressed in a way that feels natural to you. Do not get hung up on inserting elaborate metaphors or dramatic declarations of your admiration into your writing. Instead, focus on simply being yourself and speaking in your own voice.  As you near the end of your letter, tell the person how their presence has affected you. The girl you're writing to may be flattered to know she made an impact on your life. Talk about how she makes your days better and why you appreciate her.This may be something small, as you don't know this girl yet. However, even a small impact can be flattering. For example, maybe you always look forward to your 8AM British Literature seminar simply because you enjoy the contributions this girl makes to class.Returning to are example, you could write something like, ""I know it sounds silly, but getting to see you each day makes me a bit more enthusiastic about going to algebra. I've never been a math person, but seeing you is a small treat that makes class more bearable.""","['As you move forward in the letter, be upfront about your feelings.', 'A love letter is not the place to be shy.', 'Tell the girl why you admire her and what qualities about her most intrigue you.', 'Go into specifics when possible.', 'You may not know a lot about this person, but mention small things about her that you love.', 'For example, maybe you think the buttons she has on her purse are hilarious.', 'Maybe you notice she listens to a particular band on her headphones that you also enjoy.', ""Be upfront about why you've never approached her in person."", 'While many people enjoy anonymous love letters, there is always the risk of coming off the wrong way.', ""You don't want the recipient to feel like she's being watched."", ""It can help if you assure her, at some point, you're a relatively normal person who happens to feel more comfortable expressing feelings in writing."", 'There are a variety of reasons you may prefer writing a love letter.', 'You could be shy, for example, and find expressing yourself easier in words.', ""Maybe you only see her when she's at work and don't want to bother her."", 'Whatever you reason, make sure you state it early on.', 'You want to make sure the recipient understands why you chose a letter over simply talking to her.', 'This way, you can help avoid potential confusion or discomfort.', ""Returning to the example of the girl you know in algebra class, you may hesitate to approach her because you're shy."", 'You could write something like, ""I always want to talk to you in person.', ""However, I'm very shy by nature."", ""Now that we're halfway through the semester, I'm worried I'll never get the courage together."", 'So, I decided to write you a letter.', '"", Oftentimes, people end up inadvertently talking about themselves in a love letter.', 'While you should certainly talk about your own feelings, make sure to focus primarily on the recipient.', 'As you write the letter, express what you like about this person.', ""If you admire that she's always listening to Elliot Smith on her headphones, say so."", 'However, do not go on a 3 paragraph anecdote about your own admiration for Smith.', 'Use specifics when possible.', ""If you're writing to a relative stranger, specifics may be hard."", 'However, small things go a long way.', 'Do you love the coconut-like smell of her shampoo?', 'Do you enjoy how she laughs to herself during downtime at the coffee shop?', ""Do you remember a comment she made in class that was particularly insightful?Let's return to the algebra class example."", 'You could write something like, ""I notice you\'re always listening to Elliot Smith.', 'I am a big fan of his as well.', ""I'm impressed by how drawn in you seem to the music."", 'You seem to have an intense appreciation for art.', '"", You don\'t have to write in a lofty, elevated style if it doesn\'t come naturally to you.', 'The primary purpose of a love letter is to express your feelings in a way that makes the recipient feel good about herself.', 'The best way to do this is to simply be yourself and use your own words.', 'This will sound more authentic and sincere when expressed in a way that feels natural to you.', 'Do not get hung up on inserting elaborate metaphors or dramatic declarations of your admiration into your writing.', 'Instead, focus on simply being yourself and speaking in your own voice.', 'As you near the end of your letter, tell the person how their presence has affected you.', ""The girl you're writing to may be flattered to know she made an impact on your life."", 'Talk about how she makes your days better and why you appreciate her.', ""This may be something small, as you don't know this girl yet."", 'However, even a small impact can be flattering.', 'For example, maybe you always look forward to your 8AM British Literature seminar simply because you enjoy the contributions this girl makes to class.', 'Returning to are example, you could write something like, ""I know it sounds silly, but getting to see you each day makes me a bit more enthusiastic about going to algebra.', 'I\'ve never been a math person, but seeing you is a small treat that makes class more bearable.""']"

Look your best. Go up and say hello. Look for chances to talk to him again. Make friends with some of his friends. Notice his personality. Share some hobbies. Develop some inside jokes. Keep the friendship going!,How to Befriend a Guy,"One of the first impressions a guy has of a girl is her physical appearance. Make sure you look good every day, as you're never sure of when a good chance to approach your guy might pop up. Clothes are a part of looking good, but also make sure to be clean and appear sociable. , This is the hardest and most nerve wrecking part of starting a friendship, but it's got to be done sometime! Look for a good chance to introduce yourself, perhaps when he's alone or walking down the hall. Your first talk can go anywhere from a simple ""hey,"" or the start of an entire conversation!If you guys have mutual friends, you can have them introduce you two.If you don't know any of his friends, it's generally not a wise choice to interrupt him when he's with his mates. That will be awkward and he won't be able to focus on getting to know you better.  Once you've said hi to your guy, don't just leave him hanging there! Find opportunities to talk to him again and introduce yourself a bit more. Look and see if he's in any of your classes, and talk to him about the subject or about random things. If you're lucky, you can exchange phone numbers or MSN, AIM, Skype, or OoVoo screen names. Keep in touch!If you guys share a class, talking about your teachers or the subject is an easy way to start a conversation. From there on you can find out a few more things about him.  Notice who your boy talks to. Try to make friends with them too. This will bring in chances for you and your guy to go out with a bunch of friends and get to know each other more. Besides, he will definitely appreciate you for being nice to his mates.  Just like how all girls are different, all guys are different as well. Some guys are sensitive and need to be treated carefully, some are out loud and jokey. Make sure to treat your new guy friend as a real person, not just as another boy. Talk to him, get to know his hobbies and his problems. Share some of yours as well.  He likes sports? Mention something sportive you do and show off once in a while. Acting is his thing? Feel free to dramatize in a funny moment! Show an interest in what he likes and maybe join a club with him. Remember that to share a hobby, you don't necessarily have to participate in it as well. Just appreciating his liking is enough.  Share a few funny moments between the two of you and keep it going as an inside joke. It'll entertain the both of you and make it feel like you're keeping a secret; always something good to have!, Once you know him as a friend, stay in contact.

Prepare your lips. Dress your best. Have fresh breath. Choose the right location. Relax.,How to Get a Boy to Kiss You1,"The first step in getting a boy to kiss you is to have utterly kissable, irresistible lips. Nobody want to kiss dry, cracked lips so get a good lip balm and apply it frequently for perfectly hydrated lips. Before the actual kissing, you should apply a light layer of lip balm so your lips are smooth and perhaps delicately flavoured. You should avoid bright lipsticks and sticky lip glosses however, as these can get messy and even ruin your kiss.For moisturization, petroleum jelly or a lip balm stick will work well. You can also try exfoliating your lips by gently rubbing them with a damp washcloth or toothbrush. This will get them extra smooth.If you have a date planned, try preparing your lips a couple of days in advance. Otherwise you should keep some lip balm in your purse for emergency situations. , Always try to look your best around the boy you're hoping to kiss. You'll feel way more confident if your hair looks good or you're wearing your favourite skirt, and confidence is super important when it comes to kissing. Try wearing a top that brings out the color of your eyes, or apply a little mascara to show off your long eyelashes.Just be aware that looking your best doesn't mean you should go over the top. You don't need to wear a ton of make-up and you certainly don't need to wear skimpy clothes. Guys tend to go for girls who are natural and feel comfortable in their own skin, so try to let your natural beauty shine through.Smelling good also helps - if you have a date planned, make sure your hair is freshly washed and apply a little of your favourite perfume (though nothing overpowering) on your wrists and behind your ears.  This probably goes without saying, but you should always try your best to have fresh breath whenever there's a chance of kissing. You can do this by brushing your teeth as often as possible, especially after eating. You should also keep a little tin of breath mints in your purse, so you can pop one as soon as things look promising. Don't be afraid to offer him one either, he might take it as a hint, which is exactly what you want!Try carrying a travel-size toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse if you're planning on grabbing a bite with the boy you like. That way you can pop to the restroom for a quick refresher after eating. If possible, use a little mouthwash as well.You should also try to avoid eating foods with a lot of garlic, anything too spicy or anything that might make you burp (not attractive) before or during a date.  You want to remember your first kiss with this guy as romantic, right? Then make sure to choose an appropriate location. Large, loud parties in front of all your friends are not a good idea. You'll feel under way more pressure and it'll definitely make things awkward. Instead, try going somewhere private - but not secluded - like a park, the pier or the corner booth in a cafe.You want to be somewhere that you can talk and see each other (so he can pick up on all the ""kiss-me!"" signals) so a movie theatre isn't the best option.If you're already pretty close, you could invite him over to watch a movie together - just make sure that no parents or siblings are likely to barge in at any moment, awkward!, You shouldn't work yourself up about the kiss too much. Of course, it's normal to be nervous, but too many nerves can cause you to act jittery or distracted, which might send him the wrong signals. Kissing should be a fun, enjoyable, natural thing, not complicated or terrifying at all. But if those butterflies are feeling more like carnivorous moths, there are a few last-minute relaxation techniques you can try:Take a few deep breaths. If you feel the panic rising, take several deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Focus on the breathing and nothing else and you will immediately feel calmer, as deep breathing is associated with decreased production of anxiety-inducing chemicals like adrenaline and increased production of relaxing and mood-boosting endorphins.Ask yourself ""what's the worst that can happen?"" Really - think about what could possibly go wrong with a simple kiss. Are you afraid that you're not a good kisser? Or that he won't like you any more if it's bad? Remember that kissing is a natural thing, so it's very unlikely that you'll be bad at it, especially if you like him and he likes you. And even if the kiss isn't so great, if that's enough to turn this guy off an otherwise amazing girl, then he's not worth your time anyway.Laugh. They say laughter is the best medicine, and that goes for nerves too. Laughing will immediately make you feel more relaxed and happy and make the whole situation less awkward. Try cracking a joke (even a bad one), making a funny face or whipping out some silly dance moves to break the ice and get both of you laughing. Things will progress much more naturally after that.","['The first step in getting a boy to kiss you is to have utterly kissable, irresistible lips.', 'Nobody want to kiss dry, cracked lips so get a good lip balm and apply it frequently for perfectly hydrated lips.', 'Before the actual kissing, you should apply a light layer of lip balm so your lips are smooth and perhaps delicately flavoured.', 'You should avoid bright lipsticks and sticky lip glosses however, as these can get messy and even ruin your kiss.', 'For moisturization, petroleum jelly or a lip balm stick will work well.', 'You can also try exfoliating your lips by gently rubbing them with a damp washcloth or toothbrush.', 'This will get them extra smooth.', 'If you have a date planned, try preparing your lips a couple of days in advance.', 'Otherwise you should keep some lip balm in your purse for emergency situations.', "", Always try to look your best around the boy you're hoping to kiss."", ""You'll feel way more confident if your hair looks good or you're wearing your favourite skirt, and confidence is super important when it comes to kissing."", 'Try wearing a top that brings out the color of your eyes, or apply a little mascara to show off your long eyelashes.', ""Just be aware that looking your best doesn't mean you should go over the top."", ""You don't need to wear a ton of make-up and you certainly don't need to wear skimpy clothes."", 'Guys tend to go for girls who are natural and feel comfortable in their own skin, so try to let your natural beauty shine through.', 'Smelling good also helps -

Tilt your head. Close your eyes. Be gentle. Hold him close. Keep it short and sweet. Compliment him again.,How to Get a Boy to Kiss You3,"It's important to get your kissing technique right for the first kiss. Start by slightly tilting your head to one side, just enough to ensure your noses don't crash. Tilt in the opposite direction to him - if he goes right, you go left.If he's taller than you, you should also tilt your head upwards slightly to make sure he can easily reach your lips.Just don't tilt your head too much, or it'll look like you have a crick in your neck.  Closing your eyes when kissing makes it a much more romantic and sensory experience. However, you shouldn't close your eyes until you're sure you know exactly where you're going - if you close your eyes too soon you may end up kissing his nose or chin! Try to keep your eyes closed for the duration of the kiss - if you open your eyes and he opens his it can be a little creepy and might ruin the moment.Sometimes closing your eyes will come naturally, but other times you will have to remind yourself.Leave your eyes closed for a second when you pull apart, then smile gently and open.  Don't be an aggressive kisser, at least not for the first kiss. Your first kiss with a guy should be soft and slow - you want to avoid the washing-machine effect. Try not to pucker your lips, rather work your bottom lip in a slight up-and-down motion. Remember to breath through your nose and try to stay relaxed!There's no pressure to French kiss first time round, but if you do you should try gently massaging his tongue with your own.If you're still unsure, just try to follow his lead.  Make the kiss more intimate by putting your hands on his shoulders, in his hair or around his neck. Keep your bodies as close as you feel comfortable with. If he wraps his hands around your waist or cups your face in his hands, he's definitely into it.  The first kiss shouldn't wear out his jaw, you should always leave him wanting more. Try to keep it around the 20 second mark - long enough to get into it, but short enough that he'll be eager to do it again. Don't be afraid to pull away if you're not into it or if it's going somewhere you're not comfortable with.  Remember that he was probably as nervous about kissing you as you were about kissing him, so once you've pulled away, ease his nerves by smiling and confirming that you enjoyed the kiss. Just say something simple like ""that was fun"" or ""you're a great kisser."" He'll feel happy and relieved, while also feeling much more confident about leaning in for round two.

Decide what you like about yourself. Express yourself visually. Take care of yourself. Be confident. Find what makes you happy. Smile and make eye contact. Use social media. Pay attention to his likes and dislikes. Go to a public event where you know he’ll be. Give him a compliment. Flirt. Laugh. Be honest. Ask him out. Be content whether he notices you or not.,How to Get the Guy You Like to Notice You,"This will help you to figure out what you want him to notice about you. Maybe you like how smart you are or you’re proud of the way your treat people or you appreciate your creativity. Figure out these things for yourself. You don’t have to wait for him to tell you that you’re awesome! Instead, you have a chance to share with him the wonderful things about you, whether he appreciates them or not.If you aren’t sure, try making a list of at least three things that you appreciate about yourself. It can include anything at all! If you are struggling, ask a good friend or family member to help you. Sometimes seeing yourself through the eyes of those who love you can be quite illuminating. , Before he can see what’s on the inside, initially he can only see your outer appearance. Take advantage of this to express yourself and make a statement about who you are. This can be accomplished by developing your own sense of style. The way people dress says a lot about them. Someone in sweatpants has a very different demeanor than someone in a dress. You certainly don’t have to wear a dress unless you want to, but find a style that feels true to you. This way, even what’s on the outside will be able to tell him something about what’s on the inside.If you don’t know where to start, look at the styles of other people around you and think about what they are communicating through what they wear. If you find someone wearing something that you like, make a mental note of it.To develop your own style, go to a few stores and start trying on clothes. Step outside of your comfort zone and try new styles. For feedback, you can bring along a friend. Once you try on a bunch of clothes, you should have a better idea of what works for you. You could even take pictures of your top three outfits. Make sure that you feel comfortable and confident and keep in mind what you are communicating.  When you respect yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally, you will naturally be more attractive and vibrant. This means eating well, getting enough sleep, exercising, and staying hydrated, but it also means monitoring negative thought patterns, validating your emotions, and surrounding yourself with people who bring out the best in you. When you take time to respect all aspects of yourself, you teach others to do the same and people will instinctively take notice of this.It can take a lifetime to truly master this, but don’t let that deter you. Aim for progress, not perfection. Start with one change you can make today.Maybe you usually eat junk food for dinner. You can easily replace this with a healthy salad and some grilled fish.If are very hard on yourself and you catch yourself being negative, replace this with a word of encouragement, such as “You did a great job writing your paper today.”Perhaps you have a friend who always seems to cause conflict and trouble. Try spending less time with this friend and more time with someone who treats people well.  When you know your own worth, he will naturally take notice. Take ownership of what you think and how you feel and don’t be afraid to communicate this. You’re the only one who can share this with the world and you have a worthwhile, unique perspective to contribute. If you have been afraid to share your thoughts and feelings in the past, start with something small. For example, if your friends ask where you want to eat and you would usually just say, “I don’t care. What sounds good to you?” try replacing that with something you want, such as, “Mexican food sounds great right now.” Practicing speaking up for yourself to develop confidence. This will allow you to share your true self with the guy you like.To cultivate confidence, spend time pursuing your interests and growing your talents. When you’re doing what you’re good at, you will feel more confident.Even if you’re not feeling particularly confident, you can fake it ’til you make it! Present yourself well by using confident body language. Stand tall with your shoulders back and make eye contact with people. You will instantly appear more confident regardless of how you feel.  This will help you to be well-balanced so that there isn’t too much riding on whether or not he notices you. Plus, when you are in your element, doing what you love, you are more likely to catch his attention anyway. Maybe you love playing an instrument or excel at a sport. Pursue these passions so that you grow as a person.If you aren’t sure what makes you happy, pick an activity that interests you and give it a try. Don’t worry if you’re a complete beginner. Maybe you’ve thought that painting looks fun, but you haven’t had the chance to try it. Simply buy some paper, paint, and a paintbrush, and get going! Look for tips online or sign up for a class.Maybe you're happiest when you spend time with your friends. Being around loved ones and building strong relationships is a great way to improve your happiness. Make sure to invest time in the people you love.It can be very rewarding to give to people and help others. If you aren't sure what makes you happy, try volunteering somewhere. You could spend some time reading to seniors at a retirement home or spend time giving out food to the poor. When you see how you positively impact others, you will feel happy too.

You could even send him a casual message, like, ""Hey, it was great seeing you at the game today.” People also often tell a lot about themselves over social media, so this is a good way to learn more about him. Knowing about his interests is a great way to strike up a conversation with him the next time you see him.  This will help you to relate to him. Even if you don’t have much in common, you can probably find some common ground. If you don't know very much about him, simply ask him a question to find out more, such as, “How long have you been swimming for?” This shows your interest and starts a conversation with a subject that he is interested in. He is sure to enjoy and notice this. Most people like talking about themselves!, This is a good way to “accidentally” run into him. Maybe he plays in a band each weekend, or maybe he has a sporting event every Wednesday. Grab a few of your friends and go to one of these. When he sees you there, he will be likely to notice you because you are sharing an activity.  Guys tend to like girls who like them. You don’t have to overdo it, but just tell him something that you like about him.For example, if you are at his football game, you could go up to him afterwards and say something like, “You played great today! I enjoyed watching your game.” This will make him feel good and allow him to see that you appreciate him. It is also a good way to start a conversation with him.  This will help him to notice you as more than just a friend. There are many ways to flirt, so choose the ways that feel natural to you. Try gently touching his arm while you are talking. Physical contact has been shown to be a powerful way to get someone’s attention. Just don’t overdo it. If you come on too strong, you might scare him off!, Happy people tend to be more noticeable. They stand out. Show off your sense of humor and laugh at his jokes. This will allow you to show your beautiful smile as well. Try to make him laugh too. Use a goofy pun or tell him a silly joke. If he tells you that you’re a good listener, say something like, “I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.” If he feels happy around you, he will surely take notice of that.  If you’re doing your best to allow him to notice you but he still isn’t getting the hint, you can always speed things up a bit and simply tell him how you feel. If you’re not very comfortable confessing your feelings to him, you can do so more casually by saying something such as, “I’ve had so much fun hanging out with you lately. I really like spending time with you.” You can then see how he responds. Maybe he feels the same way, but wasn’t sure how to bring it up.  A girl can only wait so long! If he still isn’t noticing you, try making the move yourself. If you feel confident asking him out on a date, go for it! If you’re not ready to formally ask him out, you could try something more easygoing by saying something like, “A few of my friends are going to see a movie this weekend. Would you like to join us?” This takes the pressure off, yet still allows a chance for you to spend more time with him. If he agrees to go, make the most of it and try to show your interest and get to know him better.  If you go through these steps and he still isn’t taking notice, it’s time to move on. There are plenty of other guys out there. Make sure you are content regardless of who notices you. Your happiness is your responsibility. When you are happy and confident, even if the guy you like doesn’t notice you, the right person will someday.A good way to practice contentment is to count your blessings. It can be challenging when you don't get what you want, but you still have a lot of other great things and people in your life. Make the most of what you have right now instead of waiting for something in the future. Then when you finally do find the right person, you will be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it.If you are struggling with this, try making a list of all the great people and things in your life. Instead of dwelling on the one person who doesn't notice you, take notice of each person who cherishes you and spend time with them. They will help you get past your disappointment.Try to practice positive thinking instead of allowing negativity to cloud your mind. Replace thoughts like, ""I feel awful that he doesn't like me. Why does this always happen to me? I'm never going to find someone!"" with, ""I have such an amazing friend who does notice me. I'm so fortunate for what I have. We always have a great time together."" This will help you to appreciate what you have instead of dwelling on what you don't have.","['This will help you to figure out what you want him to notice about you.', 'Maybe you like how smart you

"See how often you think about him. Judge how badly you want to be around him. See whether you find yourself thinking about shared memories. Do you think realistically about your future together?,See whether you naturally smile when you're with him. Listen to how often you talk about him. Check how often you look at his social media. Check how you act around him in groups. See if you prioritize him over other male friends and crushes.",How to Know when You Love A Guy,"When you love someone, the other things in your life become a little less important in your mind. If you love a guy, you may find yourself thinking about him often — even when you don't really want to. If he's the first thing on your mind when you wake up, and the last thing you think of before you go to sleep, this is a sign that you have serious feelings about him.However, infatuation (puppy love) can have the same effect. Since just thinking about someone often isn't enough to say whether you love that person, use the other steps below to help make your decision. , The person you love shouldn't be someone you're shy around. Love means that you're extra-comfortable around this guy — you like hanging out with him because he makes you feel like you can be yourself. On the other hand, if this guy still makes you feel nervous, antsy, or insecure, your relationship may not have made it to ""love"" territory yet.If you still get the butterflies around this guy, don't worry. You can eventually love him — you just need to spend more time together and grow more confident around each other.  People who love each other tend to enjoy thinking about the rich, rewarding time they've already spent together. If you sit down and think of the things you've done together, do you find yourself feeling warm, happy, or nostalgic emotions? If so, you may have a good foundation for love.If you don't feel an attachment to your memories together, you may not be there yet. If you don't have any memories together, you probably haven't spent enough time with this guy for love to develop.  It's natural to have some fantasies of the future when you have a crush — running off together to a tropical retreat, exploring the world, etc. However, when you love someone, your fantasies tend to be a little more realistic. You may find yourself thinking things like, ""I wonder if we can live together when we finish school?"", ""I wonder whether we could get a dog together,"" and so on. If so, this can be a sign that you are excited for a realistic future with your partner, which is evidence for love.  The person you love should make you happy most of the time when you're together. If he can cheer you up no matter how angry you are, this is an even better sign. If you find yourself smiling whenever he is around, this is best of all. Your smile should be open and genuine, not forced.A friend can help you see whether you smile around him or not. Tell your friend to watch your face when you're hanging out him in a group, then give yourself a few minutes to forget you told your friend to do this. If your friend notices your face light up whenever he talks to you, you may be feeling something for this guy.  Loving someone usually means they will naturally work their way into your conversations simply because you're thinking about them so much. If you find yourself gushing about the latest developments with this guy even when the conversation has nothing to do with him, you definitely have an attachment to him. You can ask your friends to help you here — ask them whether they notice you talking about him a lot.For obvious reasons, this isn't a good choice if you tend to get shy when talking about romance. In this case, you may avoid talking about your relationship even if you do love him, so use the other recommendations in this article.  Today, the internet gives people who are in love plenty of opportunities to check on each other. If you are constantly checking this guy's Facebook, Twitter, AIM, Instagram, etc. to get the latest updates or catch a new dreamy selfie, you have at least a serious crush. Even things as simple as checking to see if your guy will be online to talk to every night can be signs of attachment.Of course, this on its own isn't a sign of love. Looking at someone's profile pics every night may simply mean you think he's good-looking, so use this tip along with the others in the article to get a complete picture of how you feel about him.  The way you carry yourself around your guy when you're hanging out with other people can help tell you whether you love him or not. If you find yourself focusing on everything he says or snapping to attention whenever he opens his mouth, you may have serious feelings for him. If you find yourself more interested in what he has to say than what anyone else does, this is an even better sign. Being in love with a guy means valuing him for what comes out of his mouth instead of just the way he looks when he's talking.  As noted at the top of this article, when you're in love with someone, everything else seems a little less important. If you find that you want to spend time with this guy even when you have lots of other male friends, he's definitely important to you. You may even have multiple crushes and prioritize this guy over the rest (it's OK to find multiple people charming or attractive — just date one at a time).This doesn't mean that the more time you spend with someone, the more you love that person. Even if you love this guy, however, you shouldn't spend all your time with him. People who love each other let their partners spend time with friends and family members.","['When you love someone, the other things in your life become a little less important in your mind.', ""If

You can start by laughing at his jokes, then answering questions he asked to the group, and so on and so forth, until you are ready to speak to him.When you are feeling that you two are getting close tell him that you like a boy but you don't know how to tell him and when he asks who is it don't tell him and see what he does or says after that. , MSN is good too. You could share more things and become closer to them, without having to talk TOO much in person. But remember, you do need to talk to them! Don't talk to him every night though, then he will think you are desperate.  Flirt a little. Laugh at his jokes, but not too much, just giggles, act happy to see him, and twirl you hair. Try to play sports; guys love girls who like sports. And try to find out his interests and try them, but don't change yourself too much.  You could use this as a guideline for how long you wait before you tell him. Wait until something similar to that subject happens.  If he asks who you like, just say no one, don't make anyone up. If he says no one too, it's a good sign. If he likes another girl, use it to your advantage. What is it about her he likes? Is she well liked? If she is, why? Is she funny? Sweet? If it's because she's pretty, think about why she's pretty. Is it her long hair? Big eyes? Don't copy her completely, but try to accentuate whatever you have in common. Try out some of her interests but if you try all of them he might notice and think you are weird.  There's a little something called self-fulfilling prophecy, which means that if you think it's going to go terribly, it will lead to subconscious mannerisms that will make it go terribly. Believe it will go well, and it most likely will.  Ask him who he likes (again), or say 'Do you still like her?' They might say 'Why' or 'Yeah/No, because .... What about you?'

Pick the right moment. Start a conversation. Monitor your body language. Smile. Tell him. Handle the response.,How to Tell a Boy You Like Him1,"Timing is everything, as the old saying goes. ""Make time for a casual exchange when both of you aren't preoccupied with something else.""Try to get him alone. If he's surrounded by friends, he might respond based on their presence, and not based on how he actually feels. Don't worry if you can't catch him alone, though — just quietly ask if he has a minute to chat privately.Don't rush. You don't want to be nervous or hurried. Asking him as you're trying to sprint to class, or he's on his way to an appointment, is a recipe for disaster. Instead, choose a time when you have some flexibility, like after school or at lunch.Pay attention to his mood. If he seems particularly grumpy or quiet, it might be best to wait for another chance. , This may feel tough, but it can be surprisingly simple. An open-ended question (that does not have a ""yes/no"" answer) is a safe place to start.Ask about his upcoming plans. (""What are you doing this weekend? I wanted to...."")Ask his thoughts on a common experience (teacher, friend, class, etc.). (""Did you see...? I thought that was...! What did you think?""), Open, attentive positioning will get your point across — perhaps without even saying it.Lock eyes. Eye contact will tell him that you are listening to him and you care. Shying away from eye contact shows you're nervous and less approachable.Posture. Make sure your body is open and pointed toward him. Tilt your hips toward him (if standing) and make sure your arms aren't crossed.Touch. Make excuses to touch him in appropriate, light ways. The bond of human touch subconsciously puts humans more at ease. Lightly lay your hand on his forearm as you're talking, or gently bump into his side if you're walking together.Mirror his positioning. Getting into a physical groove with him will tell him you are similar. Humans are programmed to seek out those like us.  Always, always, always smile. Not only will it make him happier to be around you, it'll up your mood, too!, When the big reveal comes, remember to relax! After all, he's just one person, like you.

"Act normal. Find things you have in common. Always, always smile. Employ a few subtle tricks to attract him, without going too far and creeping him out. If you really want to flirt, find excuses to touch him, especially his upper arms. If he is with his friends, let him have space. Don't freak out; just stay calm!",How to Talk to Your Crush if He Knows You Like Him,"It sounds hard, but if you just act and do things the way you normally do when you're around him, he won't see any reason to act differently. The main thing here is to put him at ease. , Now that he knows that you like him, odds are he thinks that's pretty cool. At the very least he's got some extra confidence in himself and he has you to thank, so you've got a great chance of becoming good friends with him, and more than friends if you play your cards right. So get him to talk about himself; find things that the two of you can both talk about. It can be anything: recent movies, his and your hobbies, teachers and classes, music, etc.  It puts him at ease and lets him know you enjoy being around him. If you don't think you have a good looking smile, practice making faces in the mirror (embarrassing, yes, but it really works) until you're confident in all your expressions. Once you've got the muscle sequences down, you're all set.  A really good one is to, while you're talking, look into his eyes for a second, then look away and smile, and blush if you can manage it. Maybe twirl or fix your hair with one hand. He already knows you like him anyway, so what is there to lose!, A reassuring tap, a playful punch, anything like that will definitely make him feel more masculine, and guys generally like that.  Also, things like playing with your hair or licking your lips a bit are great ways to flirt. But don't do things like that too often; he might think you are bored, or need Chapstick or something like that.  Also, make sure you're talking to your friends as well as him or he might think you're not very social. Don't forget, he might be as nervous as you are.  Be you.

Look for hints that they like you back. Tell them that you like them. Ask them out on a date. Avoid blaming yourself if you’re rejected.,How to Talk to Your Middle School Crush (Girls)4,"Before you confess, try to see if there are any hints that your crush might also like you.

You can tell your crush in person, text them, give them a card, or send them a message over social media.You might say something like, “Hey, I really like you a lot, as more than a friend. I was wondering, do you like me too?”You should always tell your crush yourself. Don’t ask a friend to tell them this for you.  If your crush likes you back, congratulations! Now you just need to ask them on a date. If you are both allowed to date, ask them if they would like to see a movie, go to the mall, or attend a school dance together.You can say, “Would you like to go out with me on a date?”You can also say something like, “Do you want to see a movie this weekend with me?”Ask your parents first. Your parents may have rules about when you are allowed to date.  Sometimes, your crush may not like you back. That’s OK! It may hurt at first, but over time, it will get better.

"Walk past him a few times during the day, without 'noticing' him. Smile at him once in a while, like when you walk past him or see him looking at you. ,Say ""Hi"" to him in the mornings. 'Accidentally' walk into him or cross his path and nearly hit him, after pretending to be distracted by something else. ,Look at him and then away quickly. Spend time where he does, but not obsessively. Strike up a conversation with him about something like how much homework he is receiving. Flirt a little with him, like, if he told you a funny joke, giggle cutely. Try the distracted method. Be a little mysterious- don't blab everything about yourself to him in the first few conversations. ,If he teases you, he may like you back. If you think he does like you back, ask him out to a movie or lunch. Be different. Use the natural assets you have and flatter them by wearing clothes or styling your hair in a way that suits you. Laugh and smile a lot when he is near or if you are talking to him. If he compliments you and you really like him, chances are you are going to blush and smile shyly. Ask his friends about him openly- it will show them that you like him, and they will probably blab to him about it later. Be friendly and open to him.

If he is watching you, he should look at whatever 'distracted' you subconsciously. ,, If his friends tease him when you are around, then there is a very good chance he likes you back. , Boys are generally the ones expected to ask out girls, so he may feel flattered and relieved and then accept, or he may decline.

Rehearse what to say if you're nervous. Find a conversation starter. Ask questions. Maintain the conversation for an appropriate amount of time. Discuss shared interests. Get to know him by asking questions. Be yourself. Text him regularly. Try to flirt some. Avoid certain topics. Look for signs of attraction. Be straightforward. Ask them on a date. Cope with rejection.,How to Talk to a Guy You Like,"It can be scary to start up a conversation with your crush. It may feel silly to you, but may be people find rehearsing what to say ahead of time can help. If you're unsure how to approach your crush, stand in front of the mirror in your home and practice.Try to think of ways to start a conversation. Where do you normally see this person? If you have class together, you can practice asking him about a homework assignment or making a comment on the latest test.You don't have to plan what you'll say word-for-word. In fact, rehearsing too much may make your conversation sound strained. Instead, have a general idea of what you want to talk about. , Look for observations or comments you can make to get the conversation started. There are a variety of ways to begin a conversation. Once you're talking, you can proceed to keep things flowing, allowing you to get to know your crush.Try starting with a compliment. For example, say something like, ""Hey, I love your sweater.""You can also make an observation. For example, ""What did you think of that quiz yesterday? I thought it was really tough.""You can ask a question. For example, ""Do you know when that report is due? I forgot to write it down.""Try to approach him in comfortable situations. If he's not distracted, it will be easier to get his attention.  Once you start talking, ask some questions. It can be difficult to establish a smooth flow of conversation at first. One helpful tip to remember is that people generally enjoy talking about themselves. If you want your crush to keep talking, ask him questions. This can also help you get to know him better.Ask him about things you have in common, at first. For example, ""What do you think of this class?"" and, ""Do you think you'll go to the football games this season?""Once you're in a conversation, try to ask more broad questions that relate to the topic at hand. If you end up discussing a movie you watched in class, say something like, ""What kind of movies do you like in general?"", During the initial conversation, you don't want to overdo it. Pay attention to how the guy is reacting. Wrap up the conversation when it seems to have reached its natural end.After you exhausted a certain topic, you both may get the sense there's little left to discuss. The guy may start giving shorter answers.This isn't necessarily a sign the guy is not engaged. Conversations just have a natural beginning and end. Rather than trying to force a conversation to go on longer than it has to, try to wrap it up. Look for an organic way to exit the conversation. For example, say something like, ""Well, I should head to my next class. I'll see you later."", You want to be yourself around your crush, so don't center all the conversations around him and his interests — let him get to know you, too. Once you're talking regularly, try to look for shared interests to discuss. This way, you'll get to know each other better and bond through common traits.For example, say you find out you both like Dancing With The Stars. Try asking him about the latest episodes after they air. For example, ""Did you see Dancing With The Stars last night? It was so crazy.""From there, you can look for broader topics of shared interests to discuss. For example, ""Do you like dancing? I just love dancing and musicals."", If a conversation is slowing down, ask a question. Asking someone about themselves will usually keep a conversation interesting. This will also give you a sense of whether you want to eventually ask your crush out. If you have a lot of shared interests and opinions, you're more likely to be compatible. You can ask questions like:""What's your favorite movie?""""Do you have any hobbies?""""What's your favorite subjects in school?""""What's the coolest place you've ever visited?""""Who's your favorite television character?"", When you really like someone, it can be very tempting to try and be the type of person you think they would be interested in dating. For instance, if the guy is really sporty but you could care less about sports, you might be tempted to pretend you're also a big fan. Avoid this. Don't deny your own interests, hobbies, and friends out of fear of judgement or rejection. You can be polite about it (""Oh, I'm not really into football.""), and use it as an opportunity to help him learn a little about you (""I actually really love going to see live music."").It can be hard to keep this in mind when you are crushing hard, but remember that someone who doesn't like you for who you really are ultimately isn't a good match for you.  If you get his number, texting can be a great form of communication that can help you get to know him better. Try to text him once in awhile and see how he responds. This can help you see if he likes you as well. A guy who texts back eagerly is more likely to be interested.Be yourself when you text. If he asks you questions, give honest answers. Use your own unique voice and sense of humor.Throw in an occasional emoji. Don't overdo it, but a few smiley faces now and then can come off as flirty.Allow him to initiate texting on occasion. You don't want to overwhelm him.  As you're getting to know a guy, try to do some light flirting. This will convey your interest and allow you to get a sense of whether a guy likes you. If he flirts back, it's likely he's interested.Smile. Smiling is contagious. Keeping eye-contact while smiling is key. This keeps the tension in the air flirty and fun. A smile to a guy gives him motivation to pursue you. Give him a brief smile and then look away.Make eye contact. This will convey interest.Try to introduce gentle touch. Lightly brush his arm when you're talking to him, for example.  Some topics can tank a conversation, so they should be avoided. If you're trying to get to know a potential romantic interest, stay away from topics that may make him uncomfortable.Avoid putting yourself down. You want to show that you like yourself and you're not insecure.Never say anything negative about his friends or family.  Before you ask someone out, it's a good idea to see if they're interested as well. If the guy doesn't seem at all invested, it may be a good idea to stick to being friends.A guy who's interested will often show this in his body language. He will lean towards you when he talks, make eye contact, and smile frequently.People often subtly mirror one another's body language when they're interested in someone. A guy may, for example, cross his legs when you do.If a guy makes excuses to touch you, this is a sign of attraction. He may brush your arm, give you a hug, or try to touch you in other ways.It may also help to notice if he acts different around you then he does other people. This may suggest he likes you, and may even go against the normal signs. For instance, if he is usually very flirty with just about everyone but is more quiet and shy around you, this may actually be because he is nervous around you.Keep in mind that none of these are definite signs he is interested.  Sometimes, it's best just to be straightforward. It can be scary to confess your feelings; however, if you think the guy is interested, it's easier to just come out and say so instead of beating around the bush.Keep it simple. Say something like, ""So, I really like you a lot. I was wondering if you feel the same way.""Take a few deep breaths before going into the conversation. This will help you stay calm.  If it goes well, ask the guy out on a date. Say something like, ""Do you want to see a movie tonight?"" or, ""Do you want to go to the school dance with me?"" It can be hard to make the first move, but if your feelings are shared that's somewhat easier.  You can never be 100% sure if someone is interested in you. Even if you think you've read the signs correctly, there's always a chance a guy will not return your affections. If this is the case, try to accept this and move on.If the guy turns you down, don't question him or get angry. Say something like, ""Oh ok. I'm disappointed, but I understand."" Then you can excuse yourself and walk away.Seek out support from friends and family members. Find someone to vent your disappointment towards.Do something nice for yourself in the wake of disappointment. Buy yourself a new item of clothing or other treat. Take a day off to watch a movie with a friend.","['It can be scary to start up a conversation with your crush.', 'It may feel silly to you, but may be people find rehearsing what to say ahead of time

Try to find common interests. Smile and make eye contact. Make him ask you out.",How to Talk to Your Crush and Even Ask Him out (for Girls),"Ask people if it looks good on you to boost your ego. Make sure your hair looks good as well. Feeling good about your appearance will give you confidence. , That's the first thing you have to do. Breathe deeply, talking to him is no big deal. You both attend the same school, or wherever, and assuming it, you can talk to him if you want to. Make sure that you and your crush are both at a relaxed social occasion. This could be a party, a sports event or the mall. This lends a feeling of casualness to your interaction.  If he is in the middle of a conversation with other friends, wait for him to split off on his own or wait to make eye contact with the group and say hello to everyone at once.  When you get your crush alone, attempt to sound as casual as you can. Casual comes off as confident and confidence can be faked. Even if you don't feel confident, act like it. If you don't know him yet, a good way to start a conversation is paying a compliment on his shirt, and then when you see him again ask his name and introduce yourself. But if you both already met each other, just start a conversation anyway.  When he answers, make sure you seem interested and react truthfully.  Mention a similar story of your own or comment on what he just said. During this time use your instincts to feel out if your crush is interested in you, not necessarily if they like you as much as you like them. Pay attention to how engaged they are and how they try to steer the conversation.  Ask about his favorite movies, what he likes doing. Show you're interested.  This way he will enjoy being with you even more.  Once you have reasonably assessed that your crush likes you, bring up an event that relates to what you have been talking about, such as a play, movie or sports event. Mention that you will be attending. Tell your crush that you would love it if they would go with you. This makes it less of a question and more of an invitation to something you are already planning on attending.If you want to ask him out, you don't need to be nervous. A girl can do it. Just don't make it sound so big like a date, make it sound like something two friends do together. For example, you can go up to him and say 'hey, there's this really cool movie going on in the theater, wanna come with me?"". Act naturally and friendly.If your crush says yes, get his number and tell him you will call him about the details soon. This doesn't have to be the end of the conversation, but your main goal has been accomplished. Congrats!If he says no, figure out why. Possibly he is just busy that day or perhaps he is not interested in a date with you. Use your instincts to feel it out. If you are unsure, its best to leave it at ""Well, if you ever want to go to (a movie, sports event), let me know, I would love to go with you."" Then the ball is in his court.If you are planning to ask him on a date, then bring up something like ""Hey would you like to catch a movie this Friday night?"" Be confident and comfortable. Do not be offended if he rejects your invite. Just go ""Ok."" Then change the subject. If you are rejected, don't take it personally. It is alright. There are always more fish in the sea.","['Ask people if it looks good on you to boost your ego.', 'Make sure your hair looks good as well.', 'Feeling good about your appearance will give you confidence.', "", That's the first thing you have to do."", 'Breathe deeply, talking to him is no big deal.', 'You both attend the same school, or wherever, and assuming it, you can talk to him if you want to.', 'Make sure that you and your crush are both at a relaxed social occasion.', 'This could be a party, a sports event or the mall.', 'This lends a feeling of casualness to your interaction.', 'If he is in the middle of a conversation with other friends, wait for him to split off on his own or wait to make eye contact with the group and say hello to everyone at once.', 'When you get your crush alone, attempt to sound as casual as you can.', 'Casual comes off as confident and confidence can be faked.', ""Even if you don't feel confident, act like it."", ""If you don't know him yet, a good way to start a conversation is paying a compliment on his shirt, and then when you see him again ask his name and introduce yourself."", 'But if you both already met each other, just start a conversation anyway.', 'When he answers, make sure you seem interested and react truthfully.', 'Mention a similar story of your own or comment on what he just said.', 'During this time use your instincts to feel out if your crush is interested in you, not necessarily if they like you as much as you like them.', 'Pay attention to how engaged they are and how they try to steer the conversation.', 'Ask about his favorite movies, what he likes doing.', ""Show you're interested."", 'This way he will enjoy being with you even more.', 'Once you have reasonably assessed that your crush likes you, bring up an event that relates to what you have been talking about, such as a play, movie or sports event.', 'Mention that you will be attending.', 'Tell your crush that you would love it if they would go with you.', 'This makes it less of a question and more of an invitation to something you are already planning on attending.', ""If you want to ask him out, you don't need to be nervous."", 'A girl can do it.', ""Just don't make it sound so big like a date, make it sound like something two friends do together."", 'For example, you can go up to him and say \'hey, there\'s this really cool movie going on in the theater, wanna come with me?"".', 'Act naturally and friendly.', 'If your crush says yes, get his number and tell him you will call him about the details soon.', ""This doesn't have to be the end of the conversation, but your main goal has been accomplished."", 'Congrats!If he says no, figure out why.', 'Possibly he is just busy that day or perhaps he is not interested in a date with you.', 'Use your instincts to feel it out.', 'If you are unsure, its best to leave it at ""Well, if you ever want to go to (a movie, sports event), let me know, I would love to go with you.""', 'Then the ball is in his court.', 'If you are planning to ask him on a date, then bring up something like ""Hey would you like to catch a movie this Friday night?""', 'Be confident and comfortable.', 'Do not be offended if he rejects your invite.', 'Just go ""Ok.""', 'Then change the subject.', ""If you are rejected, don't take it personally."", 'It is alright.', 'There are always more fish in the sea.']"

Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke. This takes the pressure off an initial one-on-one encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt.

Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in class, heard he would have them, and really need it to study for an upcoming test. This looks more proactive, less crazy, so if you’re going to text him, make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there.  Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later. Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the school’s last game. Ask him how he’s doing today or what he’s up to.”What kind of day are you having?””What are you studying?””Where do you work?””What are you doing later?”, Ask questions that are open-ended and lead to him describing his likes and dislikes, his passions, and his interests. Listen to his responses more than you speak. ”What kind of movies do you like? What are your favorites?””What do you like to read in your spare time?””What is the most beautiful place you’ve ever been?””Where do you plan to travel to this year?””What’s one thing that you’re really, really good at?”, Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do.

If he asks questions about you because he’s interested and wants to know more, answer honestly and confidently.Connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two.Allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes.  Stare in his eyes intensely. Use body language to show him your interest. Touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his leg, knees, or feet with yours.  Now that momentum has been made with creating a foundation for friendship, see if there’s more there by hanging out one-on-one in a more intimate setting. Connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activities.Grab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you.Find a less pressured date setting by going hiking or doing something active

"Keep your breathing steady and relaxed. Present yourself with confidence. Display open, positive body language.",How to Talk to a Guy Without Freezing Up1,"Often we are afraid to talk to someone new or someone we like out of fear of being of looking bad or saying the wrong thing. Your nerves may get the best of you and you may end up with your heart pounding in your chest as you try to talk to the guy. Your nerves always make it more difficult for you to stay calm and focus on generating good conversation with him. You can try to adjust this by focusing on keeping your breathing steady and relaxed, even if you are nervous.You may take a few deep breaths before you approach the guy. Do this by inhaling deeply, filling your stomach with air. Let your stomach puff out as you inhale, expanding with air. Try to inhale for a count of three. Then, exhale slowly for a count of three, letting the air release from your stomach. Your stomach should contract and pull in towards your spine.You can also close your eyes and repeat a mantra as you do deep breathing. You may repeat silently to yourself, “I am calm” or “I can do this”. Repeating a mantra can help you stay focused and motivated to talk to the guy. , You may also stay calm by taking time with your appearance so you appear calm once you are standing in front of him. You may choose an outfit that makes you feel confident and poised, such as your favorite shirt and jeans or your favorite piece of jewellery.You may also decide to do your hair that day or put on some makeup so you can appear confident as you speak to him. Keep in mind the best form of confidence often comes from within, so you should not stress too much about getting your appearance just right. Instead, use your appearance as a way to project confidence and a healthy sense of self.  Another way you can present yourself with confidence is to have open, positive body language when you are talking with the guy. Positive body language can show him that you are interested and engaged in the conversation. It can also encourage him to keep talking to you and connect.Keep your arms relaxed and at your sides, with your body positioned towards him. Maintain eye contact as you speak to him and nod when he speaks to show you are engaged in what he is saying.You should also smile and laugh when appropriate to communicate positivity and engagement. You may also lean slightly towards him when he speaks.Note if he is responding to your positive body language with his own positive body language. If he is mirroring your body language and displaying engagement with you as you speak, this could be a good sign.","['Often we are afraid to talk to someone new or someone we like out of fear of being of looking bad or saying the wrong thing.', 'Your nerves may get the best of you and you may end up with your heart pounding in your chest as you try to talk to the guy.', 'Your nerves always make it more difficult for you to stay calm and focus on generating good conversation with him.', 'You can try to adjust this by focusing on keeping your breathing steady and relaxed, even if you are nervous.', 'You may take a few deep breaths before you approach the guy.', 'Do this by inhaling deeply, filling your stomach with air.', 'Let your stomach puff out as you inhale, expanding with air.', 'Try to inhale for a count of three.', 'Then, exhale slowly for a count of three, letting the air release from your stomach.', 'Your stomach should contract and pull in towards your spine.', 'You can also close your eyes and repeat a mantra as you do deep breathing.', 'You may repeat silently to yourself, “I am calm” or “I can do this”.', 'Repeating a mantra can help you stay focused and motivated to talk to the guy.', ', You may also stay calm by taking time with your appearance so you appear calm once you are standing in front of him.', 'You may choose an outfit that makes you feel confident and poised, such as your favorite shirt and jeans or your favorite piece of jewellery.', 'You may also decide to do your hair that day or put on some makeup so you can appear confident as you speak to him.', 'Keep in mind the best form of confidence often comes from within, so you should not stress too much about getting your appearance just right.', 'Instead, use your appearance as a way to project confidence and a healthy sense of self.', 'Another way you can present yourself with confidence is to have open, positive body language when you are talking with the guy.', 'Positive body language can show him that you are interested and engaged in the conversation.', 'It can also encourage him to keep talking to you and connect.', 'Keep your arms relaxed and at your sides, with your body positioned towards him.', 'Maintain eye contact as you speak to him and nod when he speaks to show you are engaged in what he is saying.', 'You should also smile and laugh when appropriate to communicate positivity and engagement.', 'You may also lean slightly towards him when he speaks.', 'Note if he is responding to your positive body language with his own positive body language.', 'If he is mirroring your body language and displaying engagement with you as you speak, this could be a good sign.']"
"Be prepared. Don't say, ""I love you"" right away. Practice your ""look."",Appreciate him, and let him know. Don't overdo it. Use his imagination. Touch him while talking. Use words well.",How to Talk Sexy Around Boys,"That's what the Boy Scouts say. But we're going to use that to make a Boy Scout blush.Take a look at yourself in the mirror, then close your eyes. Think about something or somebody you think is super sexy. Think about that with your eyes closed, until you are feeling undeniably sexy. Now open your eyes, and take a look. That's a look you want to recreate!Listen to voices, and see how guys respond. Sexy is as much in the tone as it is in the words you use. Low and throaty is always a safe bet, but if your voice is not ready for that, soft and sweet works well too. , Start with saying phrases such as ""I must really like you."" This turns guys on without sounding too serious, too soon.  Once you know what your sexy look is, practice it on yourself, until you can get that ""look"" whenever you want. Try variations on it:Look directly ahead with a no-nonsense ""yes, you"" gaze.Bend your head down, and look up with your eyes. It's sort of the opposite of the direct gaze, but still very sexy to guys.As you're waking away from him, turn your head and eyes towards him, and smile. If that doesn't make his knees quiver, nothing will!, Nothing is sexier than telling somebody how much you appreciate things about them, especially the little things.When you're talking to him, focus on him, no matter who else is around—even if the hottest guy around walks into the room. Focusing on him alone is most definitely sexy. Think about it: if Selena Gomez walked into the room while he's talking to you, and his gaze never wandered from you for an instant, how would you feel?, Being a little bit aloof means that you're not going to be taken for granted. Look like you don't really care if he responds or not, and enjoy yourself!, If the goal is to make him think sexy thoughts about you, then there's no better place to start than his own imagination. Try using subtle cues when talking. It might be a sexy smile, or touching your lips while listening to him, or even saying something that is borderline naughty, like ""It is so hot today, I could just toss off all my clothes and dance naked in the fountain!"", Don't just use ""friend"" touches. Part of talking sexy is being sexy. When you're saying something flirty, run a finger down his forearm towards his hand. He will like that.  Learn how to use double entendres. Those are words or phrases open to two interpretations, one of which is usually risqué or indecent.","[""That's what the Boy Scouts say."", ""But we're going to use that to make a Boy Scout blush."", 'Take a look at yourself in the mirror, then close your eyes.', 'Think about something or somebody you think is super sexy.', 'Think about that with your eyes closed, until you are feeling undeniably sexy.', 'Now open your eyes, and take a look.', ""That's a look you want to recreate!Listen to voices, and see how guys respond."", 'Sexy is as much in the tone as it is in the words you use.', 'Low and throaty is always a safe bet, but if your voice is not ready for that, soft and sweet works well too.', ', Start with saying phrases such as ""I must really like you.""', 'This turns guys on without sounding too serious, too soon.', 'Once you know what your sexy look is, practice it on yourself, until you can get that ""look"" whenever you want.', 'Try variations on it:Look directly ahead with a no-nonsense ""yes, you"" gaze.', 'Bend your head down, and look up with your eyes.', ""It's sort of the opposite of the direct gaze, but still very sexy to guys."", ""As you're waking away from him, turn your head and eyes towards him, and smile."", ""If that doesn't make his knees quiver, nothing will!"", ', Nothing is sexier than telling somebody how much you appreciate things about them, especially the little things.', ""When you're talking to him, focus on him, no matter who else is around—even if the hottest guy around walks into the room."", 'Focusing on him alone is most definitely sexy.', ""Think about it: if Selena Gomez walked into the room while he's talking to you, and his gaze never wandered from you for an instant, how would you feel?,"", ""Being a little bit aloof means that you're not going to be taken for granted."", ""Look like you don't really care if he responds or not, and enjoy yourself!, If the goal is to make him think sexy thoughts about you, then there's no better place to start than his own imagination."", 'Try using subtle cues when talking.', 'It might be a sexy smile, or touching your lips while listening to him, or even saying something that is borderline naughty, like ""It is so hot today, I could just toss off all my clothes and dance naked in the fountain!"", Don\'t just use ""friend"" touches.', 'Part of talking sexy is being sexy.', ""When you're saying something flirty, run a finger down his forearm towards his hand."", 'He will like that.', 'Learn how to use double entendres.', 'Those are words or phrases open to two interpretations, one of which is usually risqué or indecent.']"
Start with small talk and be friendly. Ask thoughtful questions. Share information about yourself. Be a good listener. Tell a joke to lighten the mood.,How to Talk to a Guy Without Freezing Up2,"One of the more challenging moments of starting a conversation is the opening lines. You can tackle this challenge head on by starting with a friendly smile, making eye contact, and using small talk. Small talk is good at breaking the ice and being friendly while still being casual and calm.Try to use small talk that is direct but also open ended. Rather than say, “Hi, how are you?”, frame the conversation by saying, “Hi, how was your weekend?” or “How was your day?” This gives the guy a chance to tell you about his weekend or his day, leading to more conversation and connection.  Once you have broken the ice with an engaging question, you may then ask follow up questions about something the guy mentions in his response. Focus on maintaining positive body language as you ask him questions as this will indicate to him that you would like to continue the conversation with him.For example, if the guy mentions he struggled with a test that day, you may ask, “What did you have trouble on?” or you may say, “I remember taking that test, and it was difficult. I can study with you next time if you’d like?” Be helpful and open, as he will feed off of your positive energy and respond in kind.You may also ask him thoughtful questions that will help to create an interesting conversation. For example, maybe you both just handed in a difficult assignment and are talking in the hallway. You may ask, “Did you find the assignment difficult?” or you may make a light hearted comment that you can both bond over, such as, “I hope I passed. How do you think you did?”, During the conversation, you should also be willing to share information about yourself and respond to his questions. Providing detailed answers to his questions will show him you are engaged in the conversation and interested in connecting with him. Though you may be a bit uncomfortable sharing information about yourself, it will help the guy to feel more at ease and indicate to him that you are trying to build a relationship with him.For example, if he asks you “How was your weekend?” avoid answering with “Good” or “Okay”. Instead, you may tell a funny moment that happened over the weekend when you were out with friends or family. Or, you may tell him you spent most of the weekend studying or reading, but you did get a chance to go for a walk or go to the gym. Try to be honest and also focus on details that might add interest to the conversation.  You can also foster good conversation with the guy by being a good listener when he speaks. You can do this by maintaining eye contact with him, nodding your head, and smiling when he speaks. You can also take a moment to process what he is saying in a thoughtful way before you respond to him to show him you are listening.Being a good listener also means asking thoughtful questions and then not interrupting the guy when he speaks. Demonstrating good listening skills will also allow him to show you the same courtesy when you are speaking.  Humor is always a good way to get over any awkwardness, especially if you are talking to a guy for the first time. You can make a joke by commenting on something you did over the weekend in a funny way or by referring to yourself in a self deprecating way.

Keep it simple. Break the ice online. Ask questions. Talk to guys in your group of friends. Join a co-ed club.,How to Stop Being Boy Shy1,"Don't worry about saying the best thing. Just say, “Hi,” or if a guy is wearing a nice shirt, compliment him by saying, “I like your shirt.” Ask how his weekend went by saying, “Did you do anything fun this weekend?” Whatever you say, say it with a smile and try to stay calm.You can talk about a class you share. Try saying something like, ""How'd you do on the test in math?""If you notice they have a phone case or t-shirt or talk about your favorite band, say, ""I really like them too. Did you know they're coming to town next week?"";, Reach out first through social media like Facebook or Twitter. Chatting online can be much easier than in real life, because you can think of what you want to say before you say it without awkward silences. This lets you get to know him better, so it’s easier to talk in person later on.If you're messaging a guy for the first time online, say hi and remind them how they know you. Say something like, ""Hi, we have math class together. Have you studied for the test yet?""You can also bring up a common interest by saying something like, ""Did I see you at the new comic book movie this weekend?""If you're having a get together or party, inviting the guy online is a great first move. Say something like, ""Hey, I'm having people over this weekend for a back to school party, and it would be great, if you could come."", This is a great way to be more outgoing with guys without having to say a lot. When you ask questions, people feel you’re interested in them and they may be more willing to talk. You can say something as simple as, “How did you like the book we read in English?” This will start a conversation, and you can listen quietly, which may help to calm your nerves.Don’t ask random questions. Going up to someone and saying, “What’s your favorite color?” is not likely to get much of a response. Instead, ask questions about a class or shared interest, so it makes sense for you to ask and for him to answer.Listen when they respond. It’s easier to come up with additional questions or insightful responses, if you’re actually paying attention to what they say to you. Plus, no one likes to feel ignored, especially by someone who asked him a question to begin with.  This is generally a less awkward situation because if you feel shy or can’t think of anything else to say, there are other people to fill the silence. Having your friends there for support will also make you feel sure of yourself, so it’s easier to talk openly.  This is a great way to meet people and in most cases, there’s a built-in topic of conversation. Sometimes there’s even a specific agenda of subjects that have to be covered. Talking to a guy who you know shares at least one interest, may be easier than just approaching guys if you feel shy around them.If it's your first meeting with the club, say something like, ""I just joined this club. How long have you been involved?""You can ask a guy something like, ""What go you interested in French club?""If you have an upcoming even with the club, you can ask, ""Are you going to the service project this weekend?""","[""Don't worry about saying the best thing."", 'Just say, “Hi,” or if a guy is wearing a nice shirt, compliment him by saying, “I like your shirt.”', 'Ask how his weekend went by saying, “Did you do anything fun this weekend?”', 'Whatever you say, say it with a smile and try to stay calm.', 'You can talk about a class you share.', 'Try saying something like, ""How\'d you do on the test in math?""If you notice they have a phone case or t-shirt or talk about your favorite band, say, ""I really like them too.', 'Did you know they\'re coming to town next week?"";, Reach out first through social media like Facebook or Twitter.', 'Chatting online can be much easier than in real life, because you can think of what you want to say before you say it without awkward silences.', 'This lets you get to know him better, so it’s easier to talk in person later on.', ""If you're messaging a guy for the first time online, say hi and remind them how they know you."", 'Say something like, ""Hi, we have math class together.', 'Have you studied for the test yet?""You can also bring up a common interest by saying something like, ""Did I see you at the new comic book movie this', 'weekend?""If you\'re having a get together or party, inviting the guy online is a great first move.', 'Say something like, ""Hey, I\'m having people over this weekend for a back to school party, and it would be great, if you could come.', '"", This is a great way to be more outgoing with guys without having to say a lot.', 'When you ask questions, people feel you’re interested in them and they may be more willing to talk.', 'You can say something as simple as, “How did you like the book we read in English?”', 'This will start a conversation, and you can listen quietly, which may help to calm your nerves.', 'Don’t ask random questions.', 'Going up to someone and saying, “What’s your favorite color?” is not likely to get much of a response.', 'Instead, ask questions about a class or shared interest, so it makes sense for you to ask and for him to answer.', 'Listen when they respond.', 'It’s easier to come up with additional questions or insightful responses, if you’re actually paying attention to what they say to you.', 'Plus, no one likes to feel ignored, especially by someone who asked him a question to begin with.', 'This is generally a less awkward situation because if you feel shy or can’t think of anything else to say, there are other people to fill the silence.', 'Having your friends there for support will also make you feel sure of yourself, so it’s easier to talk openly.', 'This is a great way to meet people and in most cases, there’s a built-in topic of conversation.', 'Sometimes there’s even a specific agenda of subjects that have to be covered.', 'Talking to a guy who you know shares at least one interest, may be easier than just approaching guys if you feel shy around them.', 'If it\'s your first meeting with the club, say something like, ""I just joined this club.', 'How long have you been involved?""You', 'can ask a guy something like, ""What go you interested in French club?""If you have an upcoming even with the club, you can ask, ""Are you going to the service project this weekend?""']"
"Remember that your crush is just a normal person. Do something that boosts your confidence. Start with small, easy interactions before trying a full-on conversation with your crush. Figure out what you have in common. Ask a friend to be your backup. Keep your cool. Own it and laugh it off. Don't dwell. Practice your social skills with other people. Be kind to yourself. Get busy pursuing your interests and getting involved in activities.",How to Stop Getting Embarrassed Around Your Crush (for Girls),"While he or she may seem perfect in your eyes, your crush is just like you. When you have a crush, you may be experiencing the ""halo effect,"" which causes you to see that person as flawless.You need to remember that your crush is a human being who makes mistakes, and is no better or worse than anyone else (including you!).Try the old public speaking tip: to calm your nerves, imagine the audience is in their underwear. In this case, imagine your crush in a vulnerable or silly position: in their underwear, going to the bathroom, or getting potty-trained as a kid!Try not to think of your crush as ""the cutest, smartest, most perfect person,"" but as ""that person I sit next to in biology.""Idolizing your crush may prevent you from seeing things that are not so good about them. You might be so caught up in how cute they are, you miss that they're actually not a nice person, and not someone you really want to be with at all. , If you have third period english with your crush, or you know you're going to see them later, do something that will put you in a confident, positive mindset. It can be as simple as wearing your favorite color or a meaningful piece of jewelry. Maybe just stopping into the bathroom before class to apply some lip gloss, practice your best smile, and make sure nothing is in your teeth will help you feel your best.Try wearing a necklace or ring that was a gift from someone who loves you. When you're feeling nervous, touch your jewelry to remind yourself that regardless of how things go with your crush, there are plenty of people who think you are amazing.Try striking a power pose before you see them. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, hands on your hips, shoulders back. This ""wonder woman"" pose can actually change your chemistry, making you feel more confident, more likely to take risks, and better able to cope with stress.  It can be as simple as saying ""Hey"" when you pass them in the halls, or asking them what the homework was (you forgot to write it down). These little moments will make talking to your crush seem normal and not so scary.  Don't listen to advice that tells you to fake interest in your crush's passions. Instead, find out which passions you both share. This can help humanize your crush and will also give you an easy way to start a conversation with them. If you're obsessed with the same band, and you can speak about them with confidence, it might make it easier to talk to your crush without stuttering, feeling nervous, or not knowing what to say.Use this as a jumping-off point to ask your crush about themselves. People love to talk about themselves and usually think favorably about someone who asks them questions and listens.Ask if your crush has ever seen the band live, or which songs are their favorite.Finding out your common interests can also be a good way to lead up to asking out your crush. If you both love soccer, maybe you crush will want to join you (and your friends, if you're still nervous) at a match over the weekend.  If you have a trusted friend who knows about your crush, she might be able to take some of the pressure off your interactions. Knowing you have someone in your corner can help you feel a little calmer and more confident.Make sure you trust your friend not to embarrass you. If you have a friend who can sometimes be a little mean or likes to tease you, then telling her about your crush might not be the best idea. She might think it's funny to try and make you blush or even tell your crush how you feel.  Overreacting, panicking, screaming, yelling, or blaming someone else for what happened will become the true embarrassing moment.Whether someone spilled your secret or you accidentally walked into a wall right in front of your crush, keeping a level head will help you get out of the situation with as much grace and dignity as possible.Taking a deep breath can go a long way in calming you down.Try to inhale for four seconds, then exhale for four seconds.As you are breathing, think about what you will say, instead of blurting out something defensive.  So you just fell in front of the whole school at the pep rally. Get up, dust yourself off,and laugh. Say something like ""Wow, that was embarrassing!"" and keep going. If you're able to laugh at yourself, you'll take the tension out of the moment, and may even appear to be confident.People are more likely to be forgiving of those who own up to their mistakes. If you acknowledge that you said or did something embarrassing, there might be a little teasing, but people will be more likely to let it go.Even if you can't laugh about it in the moment, try making a joke out of it later. It will show you don't take yourself too seriously.  You may be replaying an embarrassing moment over and over in your mind--the dumb joke you told in front of your crush that fell flat--but chances are you are the only one. People often aren't paying as close attention us as we may imagine and tend to judge others more on overall character than one embarrassing incident.It's likely your crush didn't even notice the thing you're agonizing over. Or, if they did, it probably wasn't as bad as you think.Obsessing over a moment in the past can be destructive and does little other than make you feel sad and angry. If there's something to learn from the incident (like to pause and think before you speak), then take that lesson, and let the rest go.Remember that everyone gets embarrassed. Each and every person, from the president to your crush, has been embarrassed.  Don't run before you can walk--practice making conversation, and even flirting, with others before approaching your crush. This doesn't mean leading someone on, but flirting a little with someone less intimidating than your crush can boost your self-esteem and make flirting less nerve-wracking.Try approaching people you think are cute and asking them for the time. Build up to striking up little conversations with strangers.  Stop putting yourself down and start replacing negative thoughts with affirmations. It might be hard to believe, but if you start telling yourself you are a smart, interesting, and kind person who deserves respect, you will start to believe it. Cutting out negative thinking and building yourself up can increase your self-confidence.Remember that everyone struggles with self-esteem issues. Everyone has flaws they are worrying about, everyone feels low or like they're not good enough at some time in their lives. In fact, most people are probably so busy worrying about their own flaws that they don't have time to notice yours.Do things that make you feel good about yourself. Exercise and eat right, wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and confident.  Filling your day with things you find interesting will help you take your mind off your crush and remind you that you are an amazing person with a lot to offer. It can also help expose you to new people with shared interests, and you can get to know them and further develop your social skills.Doing interesting things will make you more interesting.

"Make sure the boy isn't interacting with himself or in the middle of a conversation where he'll be mumbling incoherently as he does the former.

This will help to ""break in"" the relationship. Weeks/months of talking you should eventually feel comfortable to be around him as a friend.

It might sound crazy, but establishing long eye contact lets him know that you're listening and paying attention to what he is saying/doing.  If you get sudden spurts of energy or nervousness, try pushing your toes together in your shoes (unless your wearing open toed shoes) it should get rid of some of that energy and nervousness. You can also cross your fingers by your side, or simply start twiddling your thumbs by your side.  When the conversation goes silent, change the topic or say you have to go. Do not let the conversation go silent for too long; the conversation could become quite awkward and make you even more nervous around this boy.

Avoid negative thinking. Allow yourself to be imperfect. Emphasize your strengths. Talk to new people often. Set confidence-building goals for yourself.,How to Stop Being Boy Shy2,"Don't beat yourself up if you think you messed up or said the wrong thing. This will only make you continue to feel shy and lack confidence the next time you try to engage with guys. Instead of thinking things like, “That was stupid,” or “I’m terrible at this,” think of how to do better next time. If you find yourself rehashing the scene over and over, get out of your own head by talking to friends, reading a good book, or doing something else that makes you feel good.Instead of thinking negatively, remind yourself, ""It's okay to say the wrong thing,"" or ""I don't need to impress anyone.""When you're thinking of how to do better next time, practice what to say in the mirror, or role play with friends.  The guy you are talking to may be just as shy as you are. Part of building confidence is learning to understand that it’s okay to not know everything, to not always say the right thing.Doing or saying the wrong thing is a great learning experience. Most people learn more from the things they get wrong than those they get right. Look at “failure” when talking to guys as a chance to learn how to do better next time. Remember, it’s okay to say or do the wrong thing. If you accidentally offend a guy you’re talking to, say something like, “I’m so sorry. I get nervous and say the wrong thing sometimes.” Most people will completely understand this.You might have heard the saying, “If you fall off the horse, you should get right back on.” This is very apt, when it comes to building confidence. If you say the wrong thing and the guy doesn’t want to talk to you, that’s okay. Try again some other time.  Talk to guys who may need your help. If you notice a guy who’s struggling in math class, offer to help him with his homework. Talking about something you excel at makes you feel more confident, and it takes some of the pressure and stress out of situations where you may feel shy.  Repetition is one of the best ways to develop a skill. The more you do it, the easier it is, so one of the best ways to feel less shy is to just keep talking to guys. You’ll soon discover that, even if the guy doesn’t like you or doesn’t want to talk to you, you’re still just fine and there are other guys to chat with.

Introduce yourself. Use the circumstances around you. Ask him for help. Compliment him. Ask a question. Find a shared interest. Ask open-ended questions. Listen more than you talk. Pose an interesting question. Bring up pop culture. End on a high note. Smile and laugh. Make eye contact. Be subtle. Look your best. Don't overwhelm him. Make physical contact. Ask him out.,How to Start a Conversation with a Guy,"The most straight-forward way to get a guy talking is to walk right up to him and introduce yourself. It doesn't matter if he's the new guy at work, the cute boy you've noticed around the school corridors, or the handsome stranger at the coffee shop - put your shoulders back, plant a smile on your face and approach him confidently. Say hi, tell him your name and ask for his - if you're lucky he'll take it from there!Once you find out the guy's name, use it frequently in the conversation. People like to hear their own name - it makes the conversation more personal and creates a sense of intimacy between you.Say something like ""Hi, I've noticed you around here and I just thought I'd come over and introduce myself. My name's Kate, what's yours?"" Simple!;, One of the easiest ways to start a conversation is to take advantage of your surrounding circumstances to get him talking. It could be literally anything, from the weather, to the traffic, to the results of a sports game. You can either make the comment to him directly or to yourself, hoping he sees it as an opportunity and responds.Commenting on the weather may seem like a mundane conversation starter, but it works nevertheless. Try saying something like ""Beautiful day, huh? Don't you just love the sunshine?"" When starting a conversation with someone you don't know, the point is to break the ice and open a line of communication first. Once you've done that you can move on to more interesting topics.If you're sitting next to a cute guy on the train or an airplane, try sighing and muttering to yourself about the delay or bumpiness of the ride. If he's interested, he'll take this as his cue to respond in sympathetic agreement. Once you have his attention, you can take it from there!, Men love to help women. They're biologically wired that way. So engaging the damsel in distress routine from time to time might just help to get the conversation going. Appeal to his manly muscle and strength - it will give him a confidence boost and make him feel more comfortable around you, allowing conversation to flow more freely.If you're struggling with a heavy stack of files or a bulky box, ask if he can help to lighten the load. If you just can't seem to open the coffee jar or unscrew the cap of your water bottle, see if he'll oblige.Make sure to smile and thank him sweetly after he helps you - everyone likes a little appreciation when they do a good deed. And he'll be ready to jump at the opportunity to help next time round.This step also comes with a warning: don't overdo it. You want a guy's respect as well as his attention, so don't play the damsel in distress too often or you'll come across as helpless.  Guys like compliments just as much as girls do, so paying your guy an enthusiastic, genuine compliment will definitely get you in the good books and optimize his interest in the conversation. Paying him a compliment is a great conversation starter as you can be as intimate or as casual as you like, depending on how confident you're feeling.If you're feeling forward, compliment him on his amazing eyes, his killer six-pack or his George Clooney smile. This will let him know that you find him physically attractive, which all guys love to hear.If you're aiming to be a little less obvious, compliment him on his snappy suit, his funky band tee or his great-smelling cologne - letting him know that you think he has great taste.Compliment him on his performance at work or on the sports field, if you happen to be present at the time. Tell him he did a great job on the presentation or that he played really well. He'll know that you were paying particular attention to him.Alternatively, you can compliment him on something a little less personal. If you run into him walking his dog, compliment the dog instead (earning you major guy points). Or tell him that you approve of his choice of sandwich at lunch. Anything that grabs your attention and gets him talking.  Questions are great conversation starters, especially if you're feeling a little awkward, as they provide you with an excuse to talk to the guy under the pretense of seeking out information. The questions themselves can be as short and simple as you like. Just try to avoid questions that can be answered with a short ""yes"" or ""no"" as this can lead to awkwardness, causing the conversation to fizzle away.Phrase questions in such a way that he will be forced to think about the answer, or at least provide more than a monosyllabic response. Men can be a little dull at times, so try to help them along a little. He'll soon realize that you're more interested in him than in finding out what time it is.Try asking him if he has a pen you could borrow or if he watched the basketball game last night. At this point it's just about grabbing his attention and getting the conversation going, so don't worry too much about the topic.  Finding a shared interest is conversational gold. When you find a topic that both of you enjoy talking about, the conversation will flow much more easily. Even if it's something you're not particularly knowledgeable about, demonstrate your interest by asking him plenty of questions and allow him to do the talking.For example, if you discover that you both like to watch football, ask him about his favorite team, who he thinks their best players are and whether they'll make it to the playoffs this year. Once you get him going there'll be no stopping him, and he'll probably think you're a pretty cool girl for being interested.Pick up on hints about his interests from his clothing, desk or accessories. If he's wearing a band tee - bingo! He likes music. If he has a surfing picture set as his desktop background, that's a pretty good indication he likes to ride the waves. Picking up on small details can help you to choose the right topic to get him going.  To really get the conversation going and to find out about your guy's interests and personality, it's important to ask open-ended questions. Avoid questions with one-word answers or rote questions that he'll automatically answer without thinking.For example, avoid starting a conversation with ""how are you?"" which he'll probably answer by reflex with a ""fine"" or a ""good"". Instead try asking him ""what did you do this weekend?"" or ""what do you think of the new boss?"" which will force him to think about his answer and actually string a sentence together.Alternatively, you can try asking him an ""either-or"" question, to initiate a playful debate. Ask him whether he prefers ""The Simpsons"" or ""Family Guy"", rock or hip-hop, burgers or hot dogs. Whatever he answers, gently tease him about it and soon you'll both be laughing.  Conversational etiquette dictates that you should always listen more than you talk. That's why you have two ears and only one mouth, right? So once you've got the ball rolling, take a back seat during the conversation and really listen to what he's got to say. Let him take charge of the conversation for a while - in case you've never noticed, guys tend to like the sound of their own voice.Even when you're not talking, try to stay engaged in the conversation. Acknowledge things he says with a smile, nod or other appropriate facial expression or gesture.Being a good listener during your conversation does two things: it allows you to make a good impression, letting the guy know that you're thoughtful and easy to talk to, while also giving you the chance to see whether you actually think this guy is worth your time.From the things the guy says, you'll get a pretty good idea of his personality and you can think about whether you want to take the next step. This is important because - let's face it - if you don't find him interesting now, you won't find him any more interesting on a date.  On the other hand, if you've got nothing to say for yourself, he may not find you very interesting. Elevate your conversation beyond everyday chitchat by posing an interesting or thought-provoking question that will make him think and ensure that you make an impression. Give him something to ponder and you'll be in his head long after the conversation has ended.For example, ask him fun yet interesting questions like ""If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?"" or ""If your house were on fire, what three things would you save?"" or ""If you were a fictional character, who would you be?"" These questions will hopefully make him smile and give you a little insight into his personality.Or you can get a little more serious and personal and ask him questions like ""what is your biggest regret in life?"" or ""where do you see yourself in ten years?""Just to be clear, these are not the kind of questions that you ask to open a conversation or that you bring up completely out of the blue. If you do, he'll probably think you're just a teeny bit crazy. These questions are best reserved for when the initial awkwardness has passed, maybe after a couple of drinks.  Pop culture is the old reliable when it comes to conversational material. Everyone, no matter what their interests, will have something to say about movies, music, television shows, books or the latest crazy celebrity baby names. Once you've gotten a sense of what his interests are, you can ask him whether he's seen a particular movie, read a particular book, or heard a popular band's new record.Also try asking for the guy's opinion or recommendation when it comes to an aspect of pop culture he considers himself an expert on. Guys love to show off their vast knowledge, especially to a rapt audience.For example, if he loves Woody Allen movies but you've never seen any, ask him which is the best one to start with. Feeling confident? Maybe you could suggest watching it together.Or if you can find something random that you're just as knowledgeable about as he is, you're in luck. Impress him with your love of obscure 70's punk-rock bands or your readership of Franco-Belgian comic books. He might just think you're The One.  The final step in successfully conversing with a guy is to know when to gracefully bow out. You should always leave him wanting more, not wishing you'd take the hint and leave. After a particularly successful joke or story, you should try to make your exit. Tell him that you need to get back to work or should be getting home. Hopefully he'll be disappointed you're leaving and will look forward to the next time you get a chance to talk.If you feel that things really went well and you like this guy even more now, put yourself out there and suggest that the two of you go out for coffee or drinks after work sometime. If you feel too awkward to say it out loud, do like the girls in the movies and slip him your number on a scrap of paper.Right before you leave, you should look the guy straight in the eyes, flash him a smile and say ""I really enjoyed talking to you, *insert guy's name here*"" It's personal, it's flirtatious and it's so much more memorable than ""see you later"".  Guys are more attracted to happy, laughing, smiling girls than scowling, duck-faced divas. Fact. Smiling makes you seem friendly and approachable before you even open your mouth to speak. He'll instantly feel more comfortable around you and be more willing to open up. Laughing at his jokes will boost his ego and make him feel good, while also making you look more attractive. Win-win.  Eye contact is one of the most vital aspects of successful conversations. Think about it. If you are constantly averting your eyes or looking away you'll either look awkward and uncomfortable or as if you're not interested in being there at all. Plenty of eye contact projects confidence and indicates interests, which is exactly what you're trying to achieve. Be careful not to stare though, that's just plain creepy.  Ok, so you want this guy to know you're interested, but you don't need to wave it in front of his face. You can smile at him, make eye contact, laugh at his jokes and ask him questions, but don't do it too often or hang on his every word like an over-eager puppy. Try to retain a little bit of mystery and make him work a little for your attention. Guys like the chase, remember?, Attraction isn't always physical, nor should it be. You want a guy who's attracted to your intelligence, your sparkling wit, your sweet nature and maybe your ability to chug a pint of beer in under 7 seconds. But when trying to get a guy's attention, it doesn't hurt to look your best. This doesn't mean high heels and a full face of make-up. Rather it involves things such as dressing to suit your figure, always having freshly-washed, sweet-smelling hair or wearing make-up that draws attention to your best features, such as your full lips or beautiful eyes.  Asking questions and getting to know this guy better is all perfectly fine, but try not to scare him off either. Don't ask him questions that you wouldn't feel comfortable answering yourself. Also, try to keep the questions breezy - you don't want him to feel like you're scrutinizing his answers, as if he were interviewing for a job or being cross-examined on the witness stand. Play nice.  A subtle brush against his shoulder or a hand lightly placed on his arm mid-conversation can give a guy chills and let him know, without having to say a word, that you're interested. You shouldn't overdo it, but once or twice over the course of a conversation will achieve just the desired effect.  This is what it's all been leading up to, right? If you've spoken to your guy, decided you like him, and you're pretty sure he likes you back, why not bite the bullet and ask him out? It doesn't need to be a big, romantic gesture or anything so formal as dinner. Try asking him if he'd like to a grab a coffee (or something stronger) after work on Friday. This will give you a chance to spend some more time together without being in an overtly date-like situation. Just think of it as an extra opportunity to work on your conversation skills.

React appropriately.,How to Show a Guy That You Like Him2,"Though there's no sure fire way to know if the guy returns your feelings, there are a variety of signs that can let you know how he really feels about you.

See if he's always complimenting you, asking if you like anyone, and telling you that he wishes he had a girlfriend.Notice what he does. If he likes you, then he'll look for every excuse to hang out with you, try to make physical contact, and may even do sweet favors for you like dropping off your lunch.Notice his appearance. If he always takes extra care with his looks when he knows he'll be around you, then this may mean that he likes you.See if he's always asking you to hang out. If he's always asking you to spend time together, even it may not be at a date-type of event, then he may like you.

Don't put a lot of pressure on him or yourself and wait for a response.Just relax. If he doesn't return your feelings, at least you'll know instead of worrying about it.Keep it simple. Don't overwhelm him by talking quickly and telling him the 150 reasons why you like him so much.

If he doesn't return your feelings, that's OK too -- just show him how mature you are by not getting too upset, or even getting angry, because he doesn't share your feelings.If it turns out he likes you, then you can even laugh about all the ways that you tried to show him that you liked him.If he doesn't like you, don't despair.

Take the friend approach. Use your common interests as a starting point. Laugh at the same things. Get to know his friends. Offer friendly favors. Ask for his number.,How to Show a Guy That You Like Him3,"If you want to make your guy friend date you, then you've already set a solid foundation for your relationship. But if you're not really friends with the guy yet, then befriending him can help you show him that you like him. If you don't know the guy at all and he barely knows who you are, it'll be tougher to show him your true feelings. Also, getting to know him as a friend will help you see if you're really compatible, and will give you a chance to show him how awesome you are in a low-pressure setting.Start by being friendly. You shouldn't ask him to hang out or reveal your most intimate thoughts to him right away. Just take it easy and start building a fun and friendly rapport with him.Ease into the friendship. Don't overwhelm the guy by always being around. Just slowly start increasing the amount of time you spend with each other.Don't fall into the Friend Zone. You should try to be his friend, but don't develop such a deep friendship that it'll get weird if you try to take things to a romantic level.  If you want to get to know the guy, you can start talking about all of the things you have in common, from your families to your favorite sports teams. If you don't have so much in common, you can learn from each other, and may find yourself picking up on some of his interests. And if you want to pretend to care a little more about his favorite sports team than you really do, then that's okay too.Most guys love talking about sports. If you both like the same sports team or sport, you can talk about it; if not, you can read up on his favorite team and casually drop some facts.Use music as a common bond. See if you have any of the same favorite bands -- if not, ask if he has any recommendations for you. If you've developed your friendship enough, you can even make him a CD of your favorite music to grab his attention.Talk about your families. Keep it light and talk about your siblings or any pets you have or had growing up.See if you like the same type of food. If he finds out that you love sushi too, he'll be more likely to ask you to go to the new sushi bar in your neighborhood.  Find a common thing that the two of you can laugh about, whether it's the fact that one of your mutual friends never matches, or the creepy poster in the back of your math class. Whatever reason you both have for laughing, you'll develop a deeper bond with the guy and will show him how much fun you can be.If you find something that the two of you can laugh about, then this will create a little inside joke and will make you grow closer.You can even find the same pet peeve to laugh about. If there's an annoying teacher you both can't stand, or if you both hate a certain pop music star, you can have a good laugh over this together.  The way to a man's heart is through the respect of his friends. If you get his friends to love you, then he'll be much more likely to love you too. Hanging out and being nice to his friends will show him that you're a cool person who can get along with anyone and it will also let him see that you're showing more of an interest in him. If you didn't care about him, then you wouldn't care about his friends.You should get to know his friends, but make sure you're not ""always around,"" especially during dude-centric events.  Once you get to know him a bit, you can offer to give him a ride or to pick up lunch, if he looks like he needs a favor. If you can't do that, offer to carry something for him. Though this will be a small gesture of friendship, he'll also begin to see that you really care about him. Just make sure that he's offering to help you out from time to time too, so the relationship isn't all one-sided.If he misses class, offer to take notes for him or to drop them off.If you're picking up coffee on the way to meet him, ask if he wants something too.Just remember to not overdo it. You're not his girlfriend yet, so you shouldn't offer to do his laundry or grocery shopping.  If you've been friends for a while and are hanging out more, then it'll be natural to ask for his number. You should play it cool and not ask for it like you're asking him to go out on a date. Instead, just ask him for his number so you can text him about when everyone is meeting at the bar, send him details to your party, or whatever. If he's a nice guy, he won't say no or think it's weird.Getting his number will increase the amount of contact you have with him. Now you can start chatting through text and can take your relationship to a new level.Once you do get his number, make sure that you're not the only one calling and texting him.","[""If you want to make your guy friend date you, then you've already set a solid foundation for your relationship."", ""But if you're not really friends with the guy yet, then befriending him can help you show him that you like him."", ""If you don't know the guy at all and he barely knows who you are, it'll be tougher to show him your true feelings."", ""Also, getting to know him as a friend will help you see if you're really compatible, and will give you a chance to show him how awesome you are in a low-pressure setting."", 'Start by being friendly.', ""You shouldn't ask him to hang out or reveal your most intimate thoughts to him right away."", 'Just take it easy and start building a fun and friendly rapport with him.', 'Ease into the friendship.', ""Don't overwhelm the guy by always being around."", 'Just slowly start increasing the amount of time you spend with each other.', ""Don't fall into the Friend Zone."", ""You should try to be his friend, but don't develop such a deep friendship that it'll get weird if you try to take things to a romantic level."", 'If you want to get to know the guy, you can start talking about all of the things you have in common, from your families to your favorite sports teams.', ""If you don't have so much in common, you can learn from each other, and may find yourself picking up on some of his interests."", ""And if you want to pretend to care a little more about his favorite sports team than you really do, then that's okay too."", 'Most guys love talking about sports.', 'If you both like the same sports team or sport, you can talk about it;

Location and timing. English Class. Math class. History. Science. Gym. Lunch. In The Halls.,How to Spend Time With Your Crush at School,"There is always a right time and a right place. There is also always a wrong time and a wrong place. One of the best ways to spend time with your crush is in class or at lunch. There are many classes in this world, but here is the basic classes with a few extras. , The place where you will discuss books by amazing authors, such as John Steinbeck and Mark Twain. Make use of your time with your crush by discussing the book before class starts, whether you love it or hate it. If he has a different view of the book, then make your conversation a little flirty debate. Or if you are writing an essay or a short story, ask him if he wants to peer edit with you. If he says no, say something a bit flirty like ""You sure? Because I know a lot about ""The Scarlett Ibis"" and you would be lucky to have me to edit your essay."" If he still says no, find someone else to edit with. There's always another essay in English class and peer editing with another boy might even make him jealous.  So what if you hate problems with fractions, or if you enjoy solving problems with the layout of y=mx+b? Your math class is another good place to spend time with your crush. Suggest doing some of the homework together if you have trouble. Or ask him for help if he is good at math. It's the other way around? Then say to him, ""Hey, you look like you're having some trouble. Need help?"" Your dream boy will most likely appreciate your help.  Ah, another class involving lots of writing. This is another class that you can ask your crush if he wants to peer edit your essays on the Civil War. You can also discuss the topic your class is learning about, like the presidents. You can even get into a flirty debate about which president was the worst in history.  This is a great class to partner up with your crush for labs. If your teacher assigned you two together, that's great! Chat a bit while you two complete your work. If not, talk to him after class. Ask him who is his partner and tell him who is yours. Then say something like ""Maybe next time we'll be partners for a lab."" You can make science a bit fun with a little contest. Try naming the most bones in the human body or name the elements on the periodic table the quickest. It will help you learn better.  Whether you're a jock or rather be sleeping, it is time to break a sweat with your crush. Challenge him to a quick game of basketball or four square with others. Partner up when your class is forced to practice kicking the soccer ball or race each other during the mile.  Okay, this is not a class, but it is still a time to flirt with your crush. At lunch, try sitting with him and talk about low key things, such as class, movies, books, tv shows, or family. Guys don't want to hear drama queens telling stories about a serious fight with a friend. If you can't sit with him, casually walk by his table, wave, and say hi.  This another non class, but passing time at school is good for a quick chat. If you see him, casually say hi and smile. If you want to talk to him more, ask him a quick question. ex: ""Hey, what's the French homework?"" or ""What do we do in English today?""","['There is always a right time and a right place.', 'There is also always a wrong time and a wrong place.', 'One of the best ways to spend time with your crush is in class or at lunch.', 'There are many classes in this world, but here is the basic classes with a few extras.', ', The place where you will discuss books by amazing authors, such as John Steinbeck and Mark Twain.', 'Make use of your time with your crush by discussing the book before class starts, whether you love it or hate it.', 'If he has a different view of the book, then make your conversation a little flirty debate.', 'Or if you are writing an essay or a short story, ask him if he wants to peer edit with you.', 'If he says no, say something a bit flirty like ""You sure?', 'Because I know a lot about ""The Scarlett Ibis"" and you would be lucky to have me to edit your essay.""', 'If he still says no, find someone else to edit with.', ""There's always another essay in English class and peer editing with another boy might even make him jealous."", 'So what if you hate problems with fractions, or if you enjoy solving problems with the layout of y=mx+b?', 'Your math class is another good place to spend time with your crush.', 'Suggest doing some of the homework together if you have trouble.', 'Or ask him for help if he is good at math.', ""It's the other way around?"", 'Then say to him, ""Hey, you look like you\'re having some trouble.', 'Need help?""', 'Your dream boy will most likely appreciate your help.', 'Ah, another class involving lots of writing.', 'This is another class that you can ask your crush if he wants to peer edit your essays on the Civil War.', 'You can also discuss the topic your class is learning about, like the presidents.', 'You can even get into a flirty debate about which president was the worst in history.', 'This is a great class to partner up with your crush for labs.', ""If your teacher assigned you two together, that's great!"", 'Chat a bit while you two complete your work.', 'If not, talk to him after class.', 'Ask him who is his partner and tell him who is yours.', 'Then say something like ""Maybe next time we\'ll be partners for a lab.""', 'You can make science a bit fun with a little contest.', 'Try naming the most bones in the human body or name the elements on the periodic table the quickest.', 'It will help you learn better.', ""Whether you're a jock or rather be sleeping, it is time to break a sweat with your crush."", 'Challenge him to a quick game of basketball or four square with others.', 'Partner up when your class is forced to practice kicking the soccer ball or race each other during the mile.', 'Okay, this is not a class, but it is still a time to flirt with your crush.', 'At lunch, try sitting with him and talk about low key things, such as class, movies, books, tv shows, or family.', ""Guys don't want to hear drama queens telling stories about a serious fight with a friend."", ""If you can't sit with him, casually walk by his table, wave, and say hi."", 'This another non class, but passing time at school is good for a quick chat.', 'If you see him, casually say hi and smile.', 'If you want to talk to him more, ask him a quick question.', 'ex: ""Hey, what\'s the French homework?""', 'or ""What do we do in English today?""']"

Try to sit by him when you can, and when you’re talking with him make sure that you have your whole body facing him. Don’t cross your arms while you’re talking as this creates a defensive position.Don’t forget to smile when you’re talking to him.Realize, though, that some boys won’t really be paying enough attention to notice your body language. He may feel too nervous around you to be paying any attention to subtle signals. , Giving him a compliment will show him that you are paying attention to him. You can think about things he is really good at, or something you really like about how he dresses and compliment that.Giving him a compliment every now and then may give him the confidence to tell you that he likes you.For example, you could say, “Hey! I just wanted to let you know that I think your outfit makes you look really nice today.” If he plays a sport, you can tell him how good he is at it, for example, “I saw your soccer game yesterday. That was a really awesome goal you scored!”Don’t overdo it. A compliment every now and then is OK, but giving a compliment multiple times a day may make him feel uncomfortable.  A shy guy may be reluctant to look you in the face, but if you can, try to make eye contact with him. If you do catch his eye, flash a quick smile, and hold the eye contact for about 3 seconds. Then get on with whatever you were doing. If you are able to do this, he’ll get at least an inkling of an idea that maybe you’re into him.Making eye contact doesn’t mean staring. If you make eye contact for too long he may get embarrassed.  It may be that you are only around this shy boy in front of his or your friends, so you may not get to spend much time talking to him. When you are together, try to focus your attention on talking to him without ignoring everyone else. Ask him questions about things he likes, or what he thought about a new movie that came out.Try to ask questions that will require more than a “yes” or “no” answer. For example, don’t say, “Did you like the game on Friday?” instead say, “Tell me what you thought about the game on Friday.”If you are in a group don’t ignore everyone, just casually try to engage him in conversation while everyone else is talking.If you are alone this will be easy. He may seem as though he has nothing to say, but if you keep coming up with new things to talk about he’ll (hopefully) come out of his shell a bit.  One of the most common ways to show someone that you like them is to simply flirt with them. When most people think of flirting, they think of doing it in person, but if that seems to scary, you can also try flirting with him over text message, email, or chat.When flirting via text, use emojis. One of the most common emojis used when flirting is the winky face, which keeps things light and fun.Try to make a bit of physical contact when flirting in person. For example, if you are sitting next to each other you can subtly let your knee touch his knee, or you can brush some imaginary dirt off of his shoulder.When flirting, don't forget to smile! Flirting is supposed to be light and fun. If you are being very serious he probably won't think that you are flirting.Tease him just a little bit. With shy guys you definitely don't want to over-do this. However, teasing him just a little bit might show him that you are interested. When you tease him, be sure to smile and laugh, and maybe gently touch his arm to let him know that you aren't trying to be mean at all.  Most boys like to be reminded of their masculinity. Getting him to help you with something may help him feel courageous enough to make a move. When asking him to help you, try to think of something that will make him feel tough.For example, ask him to lift something a bit heavy. Don't be unrealistic here, and make sure that you choose something he can actually lift. You could say something like, ""Hey Josh, I'm trying to put these big heavy books back up on the shelf, but they're too heavy for me. I know you're strong, could you help me?"", Telling a shy boy that you like him is tricky because, in a face-to-face encounter, he might get too embarrassed and react differently than he really wants to. You can tell him face-to-face, but make sure that you do it when you two are alone, and well out of sight of any of his or your friends.When you tell him, try to keep it casual. If you’re not certain that he likes you, or you’re afraid he will get embarrassed, you can make it light-hearted and easy. For example, instead of saying “I really like you, and I want to be your girlfriend,” you can say, “I was thinking that since we get along so well, and have so much fun together that maybe we should go to the dance together next Friday.” This will give him a way to agree that he likes you without actually having to say it out loud.If you are friends on social media, you can tell him via chat, you can tell him over email or text, or you can even just write him a letter. However, if you are worried that he maybe doesn’t like you back, he might show what you have written to his friends. Hopefully he won’t do this, but be aware that spilling your feelings in written form leaves a record of what you’ve said.  When you tell him you like him, try to be friendly and sweet to him. Realize that for a shy boy, talking to a girl he likes is probably one of the scariest things in the world. He might react strangely to your confession, even if he does like you too. Try to be ready for this possibility, and if he does react weirdly, or says something defensive try to stay friendly.You can say something like, “OK, don’t worry about it. I just wanted to see what you thought. Let me know if you want to talk about it more some time.” This has the added benefit that if he truly doesn’t feel the same, then you have easily and gracefully left the conversation without embarrassing yourself too much.Being sweet and friendly may also encourage him to feel less afraid to talk to you.  If you tell him face-to-face, you’ll get some sort of reaction right away, though the reaction he gives you may not be the one he meant to give you. If you write him a text or an email, you may not get any reaction at first. There are lots of reasons that he may not respond to you right away. On the other hand, if you wrote him weeks ago on social media, and you know he’s seen your message, then he may just be afraid of hurting your feelings.Give him a few days to respond. He may need some time to think about what he wants to say, or he may just be really busy. Maybe he doesn’t get on social media everyday or doesn’t check his email often.If he hasn’t responded after a week or two, consider taking him aside to ask him about it. Tell him it’s no big deal if he’s not interested, but you just wanted to make sure he got your message.  Of course, it may be hard to find out how he acts when you’re not there, but try to observe him from afar. If you see him across the lunch room, see how he is acting with his friends. Is he talking a lot or is he quiet? If he’s very talkative around other people, but quiet around you, there’s a good chance that he feels nervous about saying the wrong thing in front of you.If he is a quiet person all the time, it may be hard to tell this way. Look for other ways to know if he likes you too.  When you’re around does he avoid looking directly at you? Is he sweating? Is he defensive if someone teases him? If he is not normally like this, but seems to be when you’re around he may be worried about doing or saying the wrong thing in front of you, especially if he is shy.If a boy likes you, he’s more likely to seem as though he is nervous or anxious when you are around. If he isn’t really in to you, he will be more stand-offish.  A shy guy is likely to be fidgeting with his hair or his clothes when you are around or he may cross his arms in front of his chest. Shy boys are more likely to feel nervous around their crush, so they may seem defensive, when in fact they are actually very interested.You may find that your shy boy often tries to be around you, but not really near to you. For example, he may find excuses to hang out with your group of friends, but he’ll always try to sit as far away from you as possible. Don’t take this as a sign that he doesn’t like you.  If you are friends on social media, think about how he treats you. Did he find you and friend you? Is he constantly liking everything you post? If so, there’s a pretty good chance he is interested in you, but hasn’t gotten up the courage to do anything about it.You can also try to hint to him that you’re interested by friending him (if you’re not already friends), and showing appreciation for his posts by liking them or making a comment. Don’t overdo it though! You don’t need to like every single thing he posts, rather just a few to show him that you are paying attention.","['Using your body language to show him you like him means that you use subtle

Avoid putting him on a pedestal. Remind yourself of past failed relationships. Be yourself if you want it to last.,How to Not Fall Too Hard for a Guy3,"One of the major causes of falling too hard for a guy is seeing him as flawless. Remind yourself that no one is flawless. Instead of choosing to ignore his shortcomings, figure them out and think about whether or not you can accept them. If you avoid this and end up in a relationship with him, his inability to maintain the perfect image you created for him will damage the relationship.Try having a conversation about weaknesses. He probably knows his flaws best, and learning this information from him might help to ground you. Tell him your weaknesses too so that he doesn’t assume that you’re perfect either.  When you’re in the giddy early phase of getting to know a romantic interest, you can be blind to the reality of relationships. Look back briefly on past experiences that didn’t quite work out in your favor. Consider the fact that some of those hard times could happen with this new guy that you like. Ask yourself if you're willing to go through that pain again. Ask yourself if you see the potential for any of those problems to come up again.  When you’re really starting to develop feelings, sometimes it’s hard to stay true to who you are. You might be acting a certain way that appeals to him in order to speed up the relationship’s development. While this might get his interest in the short term, it’ll eliminate the possibility of a healthy relationship later. Be honest about the fact that you love rap music even if you know he only listens to country. It might take longer for him to know if the two of you are compatible enough, but this slower progression is more healthy and natural, and if things finally do progress, you’ll know it’s for the right reasons.","['One of the major causes of falling too hard for a guy is seeing him as flawless.', 'Remind yourself that no one is flawless.', 'Instead of choosing to ignore his shortcomings, figure them out and think about whether or not you can accept them.', 'If you avoid this and end up in a relationship with him, his inability to maintain the perfect image you created for him will damage the relationship.', 'Try having a conversation about weaknesses.', 'He probably knows his flaws best, and learning this information from him might help to ground you.', 'Tell him your weaknesses too so that he doesn’t assume that you’re perfect either.', 'When you’re in the giddy early phase of getting to know a romantic interest, you can be blind to the reality of relationships.', 'Look back briefly on past experiences that didn’t quite work out in your favor.', 'Consider the fact that some of those hard times could happen with this new guy that you like.', ""Ask yourself if you're willing to go through that pain again."", 'Ask yourself if you see the potential for any of those problems to come up again.', 'When you’re really starting to develop feelings, sometimes it’s hard to stay true to who you are.', 'You might be acting a certain way that appeals to him in order to speed up the relationship’s development.', 'While this might get his interest in the short term, it’ll eliminate the possibility of a healthy relationship later.', 'Be honest about the fact that you love rap music even if you know he only listens to country.', 'It might take longer for him to know if the two of you are compatible enough, but this slower progression is more healthy and natural, and if things finally do progress, you’ll know it’s for the right reasons.']"
Be honest with what you want. Structure your note like a poem. Use quotes. Compliment him. Add an inside joke. Include a personal gift. Pick your paper. Fold the note into a heart. Embellish the envelope with stickers or stencils. Paint the envelope with watercolors. Give him the note in the hallway. Stick the note in his locker. Send the note electronically. Send the note anonymously.,How to Write a Note to a Boy You Like,"If you really like this boy, tell him that. Figure out what you want this note to achieve. Do you want him to give you his number so you can text him? Ask for his number in your note. Do you want to hang out with him after school? Ask him to come over to your house to watch a movie. Figure out what you want to achieve with your note and writing it will become so much easier.Be honest with yourself as well. Don't tell him it's okay if he doesn't like you, you're okay with just being friends if that's not true. Make sure whatever you put in your note is truthful, otherwise you're starting off on the wrong foot.It’s also okay to say you don’t know what to say. Telling him “I don’t know how to tell you this, but I really like you” is very endearing and he’ll be flattered that you were even brave enough to try. , There’s no right way to tell someone you like them, so you can feel free to be as creative as you want. Try writing a poem to let him know how you feel.Your poem doesn’t have to rhyme if you don’t want it to. There are many different types and lengths of poems, so fool around and see which one feels right for you.If all else fails, go back to the classics. You can’t go wrong with a little “Roses are red, violets are blue, this poem is stupid, but I still like you.”, If you have trouble putting what you feel into your own words, use somebody else’s. Include a quote from your favorite movie or book or add a song lyric that makes you think of him. It doesn’t matter what you say, as long as he gets the idea that you like him.  Use your note to express things you might be embarrassed to say in person. Compliment his hair or his clothes or his personality; whatever it is that makes him attractive to you, tell him. Even if he decides that he’s not interested in you, he’ll still appreciate the compliments.  If you and your crush are already friends, chances are you have at least one inside joke. Include that joke in your note; these details are unique and specific to your relationship and he’ll appreciate that you thought to include it.  Your love letter doesn’t just have to be a letter. If you feel self-conscious explaining yourself in words, try explaining yourself in song. Make your crush a mixed CD or playlist of all the songs that make you think of him.If you’re artistic, draw him a picture of you and him together.Whatever you decide to give him, make sure you include some kind of note with your name on it. You wouldn’t want to give him a gift and make him guess where it’s coming from.The note with your gift doesn’t have to be highly detailed. It can be as simple as To Jack, From Jill. The gift is what you’re explaining yourself with, so the note accompanying it can be very low-key.  Before you can even start writing your letter, you need to decide what stationary to use. Notebook paper is always a safe option, but it’s not the only one. If you recently went on a trip with your family, use a postcard from that location.Or if you have special stationary that you really love, use that instead.  To do this, write your note on a 6” by 6” piece of paper (or any square-shaped paper). Fold the paper twice over so your paper is divided into four equal quadrants. Fold the top point down to meet the crease in the center. Fold the bottom point up so it touches the top point. Fold your right side to meet the crease in the center and then do the same with the left side. Flip the heart over and fold the top points down.  If you’re passing your note in an envelope, feel free to gussy up the envelope as well. You can add stickers or use stencils to write your crush’s name out. If you want to be funny, try cutting out your crush’s name using letters from a magazine and taping them to the envelope so it looks like a ransom note.Keep in mind that he might not like stickers as much as you do. Less is usually more when it comes to decorating your note, unless you want the note to look over-the-top on purpose.If the note is serious in tone, it's probably best to keep it simple: just write his name in plain letters on the envelope.  To make your envelope a little more colorful and fun, try painting it. To do this, all you will need is your envelope, some paint and a brush. Try painting wavy lines in different colored stripes.When painting, make sure to keep your brush flat and drag it across the surface.Let the envelope dry before you put your letter inside.  If you frequently pass your crush in the halls, plan on giving him the note during that time. You won’t have too much time before you have to get to your next class, so you won’t have to worry about standing around and talking awkwardly.If you’re too nervous or anxious to pass the note yourself, give it to a friend to pass on. Make sure you choose a friend that you trust, just in case they decide to read the note themselves and tell others what it says.You could also give him the note in class. He’ll probably be thrilled to have something to do (other than focusing on the lesson and studying, of course). Just make sure it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. You don’t want your teacher to find it and confiscate it, or worse, read the note out loud.  If you don’t want to give the note directly to your crush and you feel weird asking someone else to do it, slide the note through the slots in his locker. Just make sure you’re putting the note in the right locker.  If you feel that you couldn’t possibly give your note at school, try sending it through e-mail. Some people believe that e-mail is not romantic, but that’s actually not the case.As long as you’re being honest and sharing your feelings, your crush won’t really care how you send them over.You can also send your note as a text or Facebook message. Whatever medium you feel most comfortable using, do that.  If you’re absolutely convinced that you couldn’t possibly send your crush a letter with your name on it, try leaving your name off. Your crush won’t know who his secret admirer is, but some people like a mystery. Just know that if you want to actually pursue a relationship with your crush, you’re going to have to come clean about it eventually.","['If you really like this boy, tell him that.', 'Figure out what you want this note to achieve.', 'Do you want him to give you his number so you can text him?', 'Ask for his number in your note.', 'Do you want to hang out with him after school?', 'Ask him to come over to your house to watch a movie.', 'Figure out what you want to achieve with your note and writing it will become so much easier.', 'Be honest with yourself as well.', ""Don't tell him it's okay if he doesn't like you, you're okay with just being friends if that's not true."", ""Make sure whatever you put in your note is truthful, otherwise you're starting off on the wrong foot."", 'It’s also okay to say you don’t know what to say.', 'Telling him “I don’t know how to tell you this, but I really like you” is very endearing and he’ll be flattered that you were even brave enough to try.', ', There’s no right way to tell someone you like them, so you can feel free to be as creative as you want.', 'Try writing a poem to let him know how you feel.', 'Your poem doesn’t have to rhyme if you don’t want it to.', 'There are many different types and lengths of poems, so fool around and see which one feels right for you.', 'If all else fails, go back to the classics.', 'You can’t go wrong with a little “Roses are red, violets are blue, this poem is stupid, but I still like you.”', ', If you have trouble putting what you feel into your own words, use somebody else’s.', 'Include a quote from your favorite movie or book or add a song lyric that makes you think of him.', 'It doesn’t matter what you say, as long as he gets the idea that you like him.', 'Use your note to express things you might be embarrassed to say in person.', 'Compliment his hair or his clothes or his personality;

"Be confident. Smile. Place yourself in his path. Play it cool. Make him laugh. Be nice to his friends. Use the ""3 strikes and you're out"" rule. Have a successful first date. Pay attention to his interests. Don't take him for granted. Maintain some space. Decide if he's truly worth it. Tell him how you feel.",How to Win His Heart,"The most important way you can attract the guy of your dreams is to be confident and content in your own self. You can do this by wearing a cute outfit, doing something new with your hair, trying a new makeup style, or simply just thinking positively, because confidence is one of the most attractive traits a person can possibly have and it will make you less anxious about failure, which makes it hard to take the leap and into a potential relationship.Don't judge yourself or others harshly. When you focus on all your flaws that is all that you'll think you have to offer and when you focus on the flaws of others, you are making your own brain toxic with negative thoughts.Don't compare yourself to other people. Someone is always going to be more attractive than you, more successful than you, and have more romantic partners than you. Focus on the things that you have rather than the things that other people have. , If you want people to notice you, especially that guy of your dreams, you should send a little smile in his direction and cultivate a positive attitude. Even better make eye contact with your chosen sweetheart and give him a little smile. It'll signal your interest in a non-threatening way and, perhaps, intrigue him.  Now this doesn't mean that you should go around stalking him wherever he goes, but if you know that he likes to frequent a particular coffee shop or book store, feel free to spend some time there and ""bump"" into him.It'll give you a little chance to talk to one another without a bunch of people around like at a party.Don't do this all the time, or he'll think that you're stalking him. Once or twice is the ticket, before it becomes obvious what you're up to. (There is nothing wrong with straightforwardly asking him out, but if you're not feeling bold enough this is a good way to work up the nerve to winning him over).  You don't want to be super overt and clingy about trying to win your guy's heart, because you won't come off very well. However, this doesn't mean that you need to hide your interest or pretend not to be interested. You simply want to make it so that you are interested but not overwhelming.You could try dropping a compliment or two; something that isn't overwhelming (overwhelming would be ""you're the most gorgeous guy I've ever met"") like ""hey that shirt is really awesome"" or ""I really like your new haircut.""Show that you have a life outside of thinking about him. When the two of you do talk, just casually mention some of the fun things you've done that week (even if it's things like the awesome book you read, or video game tournament you participated in, or the soccer game you won). It shows that you have interests and a life of your own.When you run into him, after chatting for a bit, say that you have to run to meet a friend or that you have to be somewhere. That way you'll come across as having things to do and people to see, rather than someone who is waiting around to bump into him.  Oftentimes the key to a person's heart is through their humor. The saying goes ""the couple that laughs together, stays together."" If you get him laughing at things you're saying you'll make him enjoy your company more and want to be around you more often.A good way to do this is to mention something that is slightly embarrassing or humbling that happened to you. Mention the time you mistook a stranger for your best friend and slapped them on the butt, or how on the way to the date you missed a step on the bus and fell out the door in front of everyone. It shows that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you can laugh at yourself.You don't need to belittle yourself or talk about how stupid you are. A confident person doesn't need to belittle themselves, because they know that they are awesome! And confidence is attractive!, He will listen to his friends' advice about whether or not to date you, so you'll want to make sure that you're number one their list. This doesn't mean that you need to agree with everything they say or that you should let them walk all over you (if his friends are that bad, though, you should rethink the guy you're wanting to attract), but it does mean that you're nice to them.When you're out with him and his friends, really listen to what they say and show that you have interest in their interests. You don't have to pretend to be an expert in what they're talking about if you're not. Simply ask some questions and listen.Don't feel like you should sit on the sidelines when you're around him and his friends. Participate in activities and introduce them to things that you like and you think they might like. It'll show that you have respect for them and that you're interested in getting to know them better.  This rule allows you to avoid committing yourself to a courtship that is basically going nowhere, because who has the energy for that? It means that if you've given him opportunities to try to get to know you better and he hasn't jumped at the chance after 3 tries, then he's probably not worth further effort.If you think that maybe he is interested but simply shy, there is no reason that you shouldn't ask him out instead. That way, even if he does say ""no,"" you will have a firm answer and won't be left wondering.The reason this is a good rule to follow is that you don't really want to be after him like a lovesick, desperate puppy. If he hasn't shown interest after awhile, he's not going to, or he's only going to show interest in having sex with you because he knows that you're desperate (stay as far away from guys like that as you possibly can). Unless you're only interested in sex, you'll end up hurt by this arrangement.An example of this in action might be you meeting him at a party and chatting with him, then popping in by his favorite coffee shop and running into him there and then chatting with him in class later. If you've given him openings to ask you on a date (or even for coffee), and he hasn't gone for it after those 3 times, stop trying and move on.  Now that you've gotten past the flirting stage, you'll need to have that first date. A good way to win his heart is to have a successful first date that you both enjoy. It'll will make him want to spend more time with you.Make sure that you have topics to talk about, because it can be awkward during a first date not to blurt out something that is more appropriate for a closer relationship (probably not a good time to go into your anxiety problems). Some conversation starters might be: what are your typical Sunday activities, what is a band or album that you loved, what was the last movie that you saw and what did you think about it, what is the funniest thing you've ever seen in public.Dress appropriately. This means that you wear something that you feel comfortable in, but which also suits the occasion. So if you're off to a 4-star restaurant, something a little fancier is in order (a dress, or nice slacks and a nice button-up or blouse). If you're going to a coffee shop, dress just a little nicer than your usual attire (button down instead of t-shirt, no ratty jeans, etc.).Remember that you want to be yourself for the date. You don't want your guy to be expecting you to be someone you're not further in the relationship. That's not fair to either of you. You don't have to bring all your quirks out into the open right away, but you shouldn't be hiding things.  A good way to let someone know that you're interested in them and care about them is to take an interest in their interests and in their opinions about things. You don't have to understand those interests and you don't even necessarily have to enjoy them, but being interested enough to talk with your guy about them, will show him that you are interested in him.For example, if your guy is super into skiing and you're more the bookish type, that's okay! Make sure to ask him about his ski trips and even offer to go a few rounds yourself. Pick up on some of the terminology so that you're able to converse more freely.Make sure that he's also respecting and interested in your interests and hobbies. If he isn't, that's a pretty good sign that he's either a narcissist or not very committed to having a relationship with you.  There is nothing that makes someone feel good and cared about than by showing them that they are not being taken for granted. Find ways to demonstrate to him that you notice what he does for you and that you appreciate him in your life.Flat out saying ""I am so glad you're in my life"" is a good and easy way to make sure he knows that you value him.Do some little things that show you appreciate him. If you're crafty you could make him something (knit a hat, carve a special little box, paint a picture).Also, you could do something thoughtful for him, especially if he's having a really busy or difficult time. Bring him some special cookies, or help him by editing his resume or essay, offer to drive his sister to the airport so he can get some extra studying in.  This step is important for both of you. You don't want to enter into a co-dependent, can't-breath-without-you kind of a relationship, as much as the movies make it look nice. Make sure that you're both getting some space from each other and from the relationship.Maintain your relationships with your friends. Hang out with them. Have sleepovers and movie watching parties that are just with your friends, no significant others allowed.Pursue your hobbies and interests. Go on ski trips by yourself or with your family, go to knitting workshops, learn karate. This way, when the two of you are together again, you'll have so much to talk about!, Maybe in the beginning he seemed like such a great guy, but it's a good idea to check in with the relationship before you start doing a bunch of stuff to win his heart. You want to make sure that his heart is actually what you want, or even if it's possible to win his heart.Obviously if he's emotionally, physically, or sexually abusive, you should get away now. If he isolates you from friends and family, if he demeans you or tears you down either in private or in front of people, if he manipulates you or forces you to have sex when you don't want to, if he says he'll kill himself if you ever leave him, any of these signs mean that you should get out.Some questions to ask yourself about your relationship: are the two of you open and honest with each other? Do you feel better with him, or do you feel like you're walking on eggshells? Does he respect you? Do you feel like you're the best version of your self when you're with him? Does he?You shouldn't ever feel like you need to ""fix him"" or ""make him better."" You should be in a relationship with someone who doesn't need you to be their therapist or their mother.  Sometimes the absolute best way to get what you want in a guy is to tell him how you feel and ask him if he feels the same way. Often you can hint and hint for ages and do everything you're ""supposed"" to do and still you won't know whether you've won his heart.Be open and direct. Tell him that you really like him and that you want to see how he feels about you, or how he might feel about you in the future.Be ready to hear the answer, even if it isn't one that you want to hear. He might not feel the same way about you that you feel about him and that's okay. Remember, it's his loss not yours.","['The most important way you can attract the guy of your dreams is to be confident and content in your own self.', 'You can do this by wearing a cute outfit, doing

"Know what type of boy he is. Find out the boy's name and write ""Dear (insert name)"" at the top of the page. Talk about what you like about him and a little about yourself. Try to use good spelling and grammar. Sign it ""Love, (insert your name here)"". Try putting a picture of yourself in the card.

You should find out what he's like so that you can choose your words and ideas accordingly. You wouldn't want to write the wrong thing to him and he probably wouldn't forget it easily if you did.You could investigate what type of boy he is by walking casually pass by him and overhearing conversations. But don't appear stalkerish-- that can scare boys off entirely. , Make sure to address him by his first name or his nickname. Last names are too formal for a love letter. Don't use names like ""cutie"" or he might freak out. 'Cutie' makes it seem like you are literally obsessed with him, which can seem frightening.  Make sure to talk about both him and you equally. You don't want to come off as egotistic by talking about your own life too much. But still, pour out your feelings towards him. Don't forget to introduce yourself a little bit because he probably doesn't know you. Most importantly, be yourself. It would be awful if he loved you for who he thought you were, not who you really were.  Every guy loves to see that the person who is writing them is intelligent and careful. You could ask someone you trust very deeply to help you out with your spelling and grammar.  If you wish to remain anonymous, leave your name out whilst hinting him at who you are. Don't sign it anything out of place or too girly because he might just as well freak out. For instance, do not say, 'Be mine forever' or 'I love you!' A simple 'love' will do.  Pick a picture that you think represents who you are well. This is optional as you might not want to reveal yourself too early. If you do not want to reveal yourself, consider drawing, painting, or writing something for him. If this is not ideal for you, maybe give him a picture of something that represents you: for instance, cats if you really like cats.  If you don't know what his locker number is, you could also investigate by casually looking around to see where his position when using his locker usually is. Don't ask his friends because they will probably straight out tell him that some girl was curious about his locker number. Neither should you ask your friend because they might go annoy or tease you about it.  Don't talk too much to him, you will have plenty of time for that later. If you want to hear his reaction, but don't want to be seen, you can round a corner and hide there to listen, but that might seem a bit creepy.","['Is the boy popular?', 'A nerd?', 'An introvert?', ""You should find out what he's like so that you can choose your words and ideas accordingly."", ""You wouldn't want to write the wrong thing to him and he probably wouldn't forget it easily if you did."", 'You could investigate what type of boy he is by walking casually pass by him and overhearing conversations.', ""But don't appear stalkerish-- that can scare boys off entirely."", ', Make sure to address him by his first name or his nickname.', 'Last names are too formal for a love letter.', 'Don\'t use names like ""cutie"" or he might freak out.', ""'"", ""Cutie' makes it seem like you are literally obsessed with him, which can seem frightening."", 'Make sure to talk about both him and you equally.', ""You don't want to come off as egotistic by talking about your own life too much."", 'But still, pour out your feelings towards him.', ""Don't forget to introduce yourself a little bit because he probably doesn't know you."", 'Most importantly, be yourself.', 'It would be awful if he loved you for who he thought you were, not who you really were.', 'Every guy loves to see that the person who is writing them is intelligent and careful.', 'You could ask someone you trust very deeply to help you out with your spelling and grammar.', 'If you wish to remain anonymous, leave your name out whilst hinting him at who you are.', ""Don't sign it anything out of place or too girly because he might just as well freak out."", ""For instance, do not say, 'Be mine forever' or 'I love you!'"", ""A simple 'love' will do."", 'Pick a picture that you think represents who you are well.', 'This is optional as you might not want to reveal yourself too early.', 'If you do not want to reveal yourself, consider drawing, painting, or writing something for him.', 'If this is not ideal for you, maybe give him a picture of something that represents you: for instance, cats if you really like cats.', ""If you don't know what his locker number is, you could also investigate by casually looking around to see where his position when using his locker usually is."", ""Don't ask his friends because they will probably straight out tell him that some girl was curious about his locker number."", 'Neither should you ask your friend because they might go annoy or tease you about it.', ""Don't talk too much to him, you will have plenty of time for that later."", ""If you want to hear his reaction, but don't want to be seen, you can round a corner and hide there to listen, but that might seem a bit creepy.""]"
Make brief eye contact. Mirror his body language. Smile. Introduce touch.,How to Show a Boy You Like Him1,"A great way to get someone's attention is eye contact. To flirt with your crush, make eye contact. If you're at, say, a coffee shop, catch your crush's gaze. Hold their gaze for about four seconds, and then glance away. Then, look back. This is a flirtatious gesture that subtly invites someone to just say ""Hi"" to you.  This may sound odd, but mirroring someone's body language is read as flirtatious. As you talk to your crush, try to subtly mimic his mannerisms. Copying someone is a way of flattering them. This will give off flirty vibes.When chatting by your locker, for example, mimic what he's doing. If he leans onto the locker, lean on to it as well. If he plays with his hair, play with your hair.Do not be too obvious about it. You do not have to copy what he does gesture for gesture. However, try to sit in the same position he does. If he crosses his legs, for example, cross your legs.  Smiling shows you're interested and engaged with another person. While talking to him, make sure to flash him a winning smile. This will show him how much you enjoy being around him, which can help convey that you like him.Smile when you first say ""Hi"" to him. When you take a seat next to him at class, for example, sit down and offer him a big grim.Smile as he talks. When he tells you about exciting portions of his day, offer a smile to show you care.Laugh when appropriate at well. If he makes a joke about your chemistry teacher, for example, giggle as you smile.  Once you're engaged in conversation, try to introduce some small touching. Brush his hand or arm. Put your hand on his shoulder. Tiny amounts of touch show him you want to be close to him.You can find excuses to introduce touch as well. If you're waiting for the bus, say you're cold and cuddle up next to him.Pay close attention to how he reacts. If he seems uncomfortable, you should slow down with the physical contact. Too much physical contact can be off-putting if someone is not ready for it.","[""A great way to get someone's attention is eye contact."", 'To flirt with your crush, make eye contact.', ""If you're at, say, a coffee shop, catch your crush's gaze."", 'Hold their gaze for about four seconds, and then glance away.', 'Then, look back.', 'This is a flirtatious gesture that subtly invites someone to just say ""Hi"" to you.', ""This may sound odd, but mirroring someone's body language is read as flirtatious."", 'As you talk to your crush, try to subtly mimic his mannerisms.', 'Copying someone is a way of flattering them.', 'This will give off flirty vibes.', ""When chatting by your locker, for example, mimic what he's doing."", 'If he leans onto the locker, lean on to it as well.', 'If he plays with his hair, play with your hair.', 'Do not be too obvious about it.', 'You do not have to copy what he does gesture for gesture.', 'However, try to sit in the same position he does.', 'If he crosses his legs, for example, cross your legs.', ""Smiling shows you're interested and engaged with another person."", 'While talking to him, make sure to flash him a winning smile.', 'This will show him how much you enjoy being around him, which can help convey that you like him.', 'Smile when you first say ""Hi"" to him.', 'When you take a seat next to him at class, for example, sit down and offer him a big grim.', 'Smile as he talks.', 'When he tells you about exciting portions of his day, offer a smile to show you care.', 'Laugh when appropriate at well.', 'If he makes a joke about your chemistry teacher, for example, giggle as you smile.', ""Once you're engaged in conversation, try to introduce some small touching."", 'Brush his hand or arm.', 'Put your hand on his shoulder.', 'Tiny amounts of touch show him you want to be close to him.', 'You can find excuses to introduce touch as well.', ""If you're waiting for the bus, say you're cold and cuddle up next to him."", 'Pay close attention to how he reacts.', 'If he seems uncomfortable, you should slow down with the physical contact.', 'Too much physical contact can be off-putting if someone is not ready for it.']"

If you have a slightly older male relative you trust, such as a male cousin who is in college, they may be willing to talk to you about changes boys undergo during puberty.You may notice some physical changes in the boys in your class. Their voices may get deeper and they may begin to grow hair on their faces and underarms.Like you, boys will also undergo sexual changes. They will start to release testosterone and begin to experience erections. Be understanding that boys may be embarrassed of sexual changes, just like you may be initially embarrassed of your period. , While puberty is a normal part of growing up, it is normal to have some insecurity about puberty. Teenage boys in your grade may be embarrassed by physical and other changes they're undergoing, so be understanding of this.Boys often undergo changes in puberty that can be awkward or embarrassing. Teenage boys may experience erections without cause, for example, and their voices may squeak when they talk.While it can be tempting to tease boys in your grade about puberty, be understanding. You are also undergoing changes and would not want to be teased. Refrain from teasing the boys in your grade about common issues associated with puberty.  While you may feel your experiences couldn't be more different than the experiences of teenage boys, there is actually a lot of common ground. You can better understand teenage boys if you identify areas where you're going through similar changes.Like you, boys are beginning to grow hair on the underarms and pubic region.Boys also experience mood swings and feelings of anger and frustration due to changing hormones. Hormones can also cause quick changes in energy levels.You may notice people respond to you differently as you grow. People see you more as an adult and may treat you differently. This happens to boys during puberty as well.  Boys sometimes treat you differently around their friends. Teenage boys are often embarrassed to be interested in girls for the first time. He may act standoffish towards you because he feels insecure. He may also want to make it clear to his friends they are his priority. Try to be understanding of this. If you are dating a teenage boy, allow him to have some friend time.However, you should not put up with disrespect. If a teenage boy is downright mean to you in front of his friends, you should tell him you will not accept that kind of treatment. Say something like, ""I understand you want to act cool around your friends, but it isn't okay for you to make fun of me."", Often, the best way to understand someone is simply to talk to them. While talking to boys can be scary, it is often helpful to understanding them better. Learn to be brave and engage teenage boys in conversation.Ask specific questions. Ask about things like hobbies, family, and his favorite subjects in school. For example, ""Are you close to your siblings?""If you're unsure how to strike up a conversation, make an observation based on something around you or something that's recently happened. For example, ""What did you think of yesterday's assembly?"", It can be easy to become frustrated with your teenager, especially if they are acting out or otherwise rebelling. Remember, teens are very insecure and self conscious. They are also striving to carve out an identity, which may explain bouts of rebellion or occasionally being difficult. On top of all that, your teen's brain is still developing, and he doesn't yet have an adult-sized capacity for things like impulse control and decision-making. If you're having trouble understanding your teen boy, pause and put yourself in his shoes. Try to remember your own teenage years.For example, if your teenager suddenly wants to stop an activity he once enjoyed, put yourself in his shoes. Maybe your teen was forced to play hockey during middle school. He may want to feel like more of an individual now that he's getting older and try something different. Think about times when you tried to explore or define your identity as a teen.  It's important to understand the changes your teen is going through as a parent. One of the best things you can do to understand teenage boys is to educate yourself about your teen.Read about teenagers. You can find reading online detailing the hormonal and mood changes teenagers undergo. This will refresh you on the changes people undergo during their teenage years.In addition to reading books about the physical changes your teen will undergo, read young adult books targeted at teenage boys. Fiction books can help you remember the emotions teenagers undergo.Keep in mind that this research may not describe your teen exactly. It's important to get to know your teenage boy, not just the boys described in literature. Take an interest in the things your teen is passionate about to connect and get to know him better.  While it's important to know what your teen is doing and who he is with, remember teenage years are part of the transition into adulthood. It's important your teen feels he has some privacy in your home, so be respectful of his need for space and occasional alone time.There are some things you should know about your teen. It's reasonable to want to know where he's going and who he's with at all times. However, you should grant him some forms of privacy.Understand teenage years are about identity. Your teen may feel he needs a certain amount of privacy to establish his identity. Things like text messages and phone calls should be private. You should also understand you will probably not know every detail of your teen's social life.It may be a good idea to change some rules as your teenager ages. You can lessen up restrictions on things like time spent on the phone and computer, as these technologies are often how teens socialize and form an identity. Keep an open dialogue going about rules and expectations and allow your teen some say in his life. If your teen continually demonstrates he is unreliable, however, you may need to keep stricter rules in place for longer.However, if your teenager violates your trust or demonstrates serious irresponsibility, you may need to take away their phone or remove other privileges. Your teen should understand that trust is earned, and that with your trust comes more privacy.  The teenage brain is not fully developed. As a parent, it's vital you understand teenage boys often have a limited understanding of consequences. This can result in engaging in risky behavior, so be sure to be vigilant. You should make sure your teen is not taking major risks, such as using drugs or alcohol.The teenager's developing brain does not give them a free pass for reckless behavior. While it is important to keep this fact in mind, do not give him a pass on misbehaving because he doesn't know any better. Consequences are how he learns to make good choices.You are still the parent, so you should still have expectations and boundaries. Things like bed times and curfews should still be enforced during your son's teenage years and you should also know where he is at all times.  Teenagers undergo a lot of hormonal changes. This can lead to things like mood swings. Try to be patient if your teen seems aggravated or is easily angered. You should make sure your teen faces consequences for inappropriate or rude behavior, but try to be understanding. It will take a few years for your teen to adjust to hormonal changes.Have patience. Many parents feel the teenage years will never end, but your son should eventually grow out of mood swings and anger problems caused by puberty.Once your teen has calmed down, you can have a discussion about his behavior. Try not to lecture — instead, focus on what he can do differently in the future. For instance, if he screamed something rude at you in a moment of anger, discuss how next time he can stop and take a couple of deep breaths before responding.  Odds are, your son will start thinking about sex during his teenage years and may even explore pornography. Recent research says the majority of adolescent males explore pornography websites.While this is a normal part of growing up, it's important you talk to your son about sex and porn.Talk to your son frequently about sex and sexuality and allow him to come to you with questions. It's important you present the facts. For example, it may be a good idea to explain to your son the differences between sex in pornography and sex in real life.If he is extremely uncomfortable discussing the subject with you, try to find a trusted third party, like an uncle, to help.Do not panic if your teen asks about sex. Asking about sex does not necessarily indicate your teenager is having sex, or even considering doing so. They may be curious, which is normal. Provide information about safe sex, such as condoms, STDs, and birth control. You can find age-appropriate reading material at a local library for your teen to browse. Remember that educating your child about safe sex does not make it more likely they will become sexually active.Leave any conversation you have about sex open ended. Say something to your teen like, ""If you have any questions, it's always okay to come to me with them."", If you need to communicate with your teenager, look for the right time. Pay attention to when your teen seems relaxed and receptive. Make a habit of talking regularly during those times to keep communication in your home open.It may take some trial and error to figure out when your teen is most talkative. Your teen may be more quiet when you pick him up from soccer practice, but get chattier after dinner. You could try engaging him in conversation then.  Whether you're a parent or a teen yourself, remember teenage boys may be private about certain things. They may also be sensitive about some topics. Instead of asking questions directly, learn to ask open-ended questions. This will allow a teenage boy to share information at his own discretion.For example, do not ask, ""Are you excited about the school dance?"" Instead, ask something like, ""How are you feeling about the dance? Do you think you feel comfortable going?""If your questions are met with short responses, then this may not be a subject your teenager wishes to discuss. Try to determine what your teenager does enjoy talking about. Try talking about his hobbies and interests.  If you are a teenage girl, it's important you stand up for yourself when necessary. If a teenage boy is frequently teasing you to the point you feel uncomfortable, it is within your right to let him know his behavior is not acceptable.It is okay to express your emotions to boys. If a boy is making you feel uncomfortable, say so clearly. You may worry about a boy liking you, but you should not strive to be liked at the expense of your feelings.Say something if a boy is bothering you, such as, ""I don't like it when you comment on my body. It makes me feel uncomfortable."" If teasing does not stop, you can ask an adult, such as a teacher, for help.  Teenagers may suffer from things like depression, anxiety, and other emotional issues. While a certain amount of mood swings are normal, if a teenager seems very unhappy or angry, you should seek the help of a therapist.Warning signs of a mental health issue include:Difficulty

For example:“Have you ever been on any exciting vacations?”“I’m totally addicted to this new phone game. Have you played it?”“What are you going to do after you graduate?”, Chances are good that you and your crush have a few things in common. If possible, skim her social media profiles to find some common ground. Make sure you don’t do too much research or you’ll come across as creepy;however, you probably have more in common than you think. Do you:Go to the same school?Play the same sports?Take the same classes?Know the same people?, Hopefully, you’ll have an interest in common with your crush, giving you an easy conversation topic. For example, if you share a favorite class together, ask your crush what he thought about the homework assignment. If you focus on these mutual interests, the conversation will flow naturally. For example:“I also love playing video games! Do you have any favorites?”“That’s my favorite soccer team too! Do you have any game day traditions?”“If you tell me what’s on your bucket list, I’ll tell you what’s on mine.”“I love that TV show! Who’s your favorite character?”, Once your crush answers, ask follow up questions. This will give your crush an opportunity to talk about herself. Ask questions that show you have a genuine interest in what she has to say. For example:“We just got back from France. Where’s the coolest place you’ve ever been?”“What are you passionate about?”“I wish I could go to Hawaii. What’s your dream vacation?”“What’s your favorite class?”, Gauge when the conversation is over. If there are long stretches of silence or the conversation becomes awkward politely excuse yourself. If you’re texting and your crush doesn’t respond immediately, give him time to answer.If you bombard him with text messages he'll start ignoring you and may even block your number.When in doubt, keep your conversation under thirty minutes.

Clean yourself. Dress well. Correct your posture. Speak with confidence. Start conversations. Find common interests. Be yourself. Gently touch him. Make eye contact. Support him. Build a deeper trust. Monitor body language. Compliment him. Go out with your friends. Give him his own space. Offer privacy. Drop hints about your intentions. Reduce your expectations. Make a move. Move on if he’s not interested.,How to Turn a Boy Into a Boyfriend,"Every morning, take a shower. Wash your hair, brush it out, and keep it styled the way you like. Put on deodorant. Even if you’re already friends with the boy you desire, poor hygiene will hurt your chances by showing him you don’t care about yourself.A little makeup, perfume, or cologne can help. If you choose to use these, put on just enough to accentuate your features, such as a suitable lipstick and eyeliner. Don’t let makeup appear thick or perfume smell overwhelming. , When you know you’ll be around him, dress to impress. Pick out your best clothes or buy some that fit your figure. The clothes you wear should not be tight, but they should fit you well. Good clothing also helps increase your confidence, which makes you appear more desirable to him.Even after you start spending time with him, make yourself look presentable as much as possible. Wearing stained sweatpants is easy but it shows you aren’t trying to look good for him.  Practice walking around your room. Keep your head up and your back straight. Take small steps, neither too fast nor too slow. When you sit, maintain your posture, never slouching or hunching. Also, don’t cross your arms, or else you’ll appear closed off. Once you can do all of this in your room, go ahead and try to maintain good posture in public.  Practice speaking out loud at home and to a mirror. Your voice should be loud and clear. Eliminate unnecessary pauses, as these will make you sound timid or uncertain. Know what you want to say and say it. If you speak too fast, slow down. Add breaths between sentences and give time for others to listen and speak. Once you feel comfortable at home, try speaking confidently to friends and strangers.Add in humor to emphasize your confidence. Don’t overdo it, but every once in awhile it’s okay to joke with the boy or someone else around you.Start out by speaking into a mirror, then move on to practicing this on friends, acquaintances, and strangers.  Approaching someone is difficult, but it’s even more intimidating when you’re interested romantically. Start out by asking for or offering help, commenting on a shared experience such as a school class, by complementing, or by making an observation, such as about what the person’s eating for lunch. Examples include “I found that class really difficult. What did you think of it?” or “I see you like the sandwiches here. I’m not much of a turkey type.”.As you get him to become more comfortable with you, progress the conversation. Learn more about him, such as is interests. Return the trust, but don’t go overboard.If you already know him, you’ll have some familiarity with him, but you’ll still need to talk and build more of a connection.  By talking to him, you should be able to find out what he likes. Now connect the two of you by finding activities you can share. If you both like bowling, for instance, you’ll be able to talk about bowling and then go bowl. Don’t think of this as a date. Instead, focus on having fun together.Being willing to try the things he likes is a good idea, but pretending to share his interests makes you look false and like you have less individuality.Go out as friends. You need to create moments that help you grow closer, which won’t happen if you come on too strong or overanalyze your interactions.  Even if hiding your personality seems to be working, it’ll hurt you in the end. At some point you’ll have to show him who you are in order to work towards a relationship. Now is the best time to reveal yourself and judge whether he will get along with you. If you like pop music, clothes, romantic comedies, and video games, for example, allow this to come out naturally. Don’t hide your true self.  Physical contact is a great way to make him associate the pleasant feeling of touch with you. Choose opportune times, but let your contact appear unintentional. When talking to him, touch his hand or wrist. Stand close to him in crowds. Brush against his shoulders while passing.When you’re first starting out with him, keep touch brief and not too intimate. You want to build his interest and coming on strong can make your affections seem less valuable in the long run.  At opportune times, lock onto his eyes. Eye contact is difficult since it will often make you feel vulnerable, but it is powerful. At a party, pick him out of the room and meet his eyes for at least a moment. When you’re talking or doing something fun, meet his eyes and linger for a moment.The eye contact in these moments should feel intense. If it doesn’t, that’s a sign that you still have to work at getting closer to him.  You want to be around him, so you have to treat him like you value his company. Encourage him during difficult times. If he had a rough day, reassure him. Wish him luck for tomorrow. Support his goals. Never turn against him when someone’s fighting with him. Instead, show that you appreciate him by complimenting his positive qualities and actions.This includes focusing your attention on him. Don’t get distracted by the attention from other boys.  A relationship can’t operate without trust. Over time, show him that he can open up to you about whatever he thinks or feels. Listen to him without judgment and don’t gossip with your friends. The gossip, even if it doesn’t come back to you, will make him reluctant to tell you anything and will stop you from bonding.To build this trust, you’ll also have to share your own life when appropriate. Confide your fears, hopes, and problems.  Look at the signs and adjust your approach. If he’s interested in you, he’ll want to be around you and make excuses to be close. He’ll lean towards you, keep his legs and arms uncrossed, his hands unclenched, and have his toes pointed at you. He may also make extended eye contact or look down bashfully.These are only signs, so they don’t guarantee he likes you enough to be your boyfriend. Continue spending time with him to gauge his feelings.If he doesn’t do many of these signs, he still may like you. He may be good at hiding his feelings or shy.If his body language is negative, stop what you’re doing. Readjust your behavior by repeating steps. He may simply not be into you.Mirroring body language often helps. If he’s tilting his head while looking at you, keep your head tilted too, for instance.  Eye contact and gentle touch are starts to more serious flirting. Start making your intentions more concrete. Come up with clever lines at opportune times that show you appreciate him and aren’t afraid to show it. For example, tell him, “You should wear that shirt, it makes you look cute” before you see him. Add in appropriate touches, such as putting a hand on his shirt as you pick up the material between your fingers.Don’t go overboard on this. Appear cool and controlled or else you run the risk of smothering him with attention.  You want to spend time with him, but too much time means you’re too close. You have to make him want to be with you and miss you while you’re not around. Don’t tend to his needs all the time. Put down the phone on occasion, after you let him know you’re going out, and make yourself seem socially desirable.Even in a relationship, you need to live your own life. Tend to those other aspects, such as friends, school, or work.  It’s important that you don’t smother him either. Being needy, demanding all his attention is a sure way to extinguish any feelings he’s developing. Keep your own distance from time to time. The absence can make him realize how much he needs you, even if the space you gave him came from something like sleeping in and missing his texts for a few hours.  It’ll be tempting for you to stalk his social media or go through his phone when he leaves it near you. Doing this makes you look controlling. It shows that you have no trust in him, so you feel justified to invade his personal space and spy on him. Don’t question him about every little detail that comes from him interacting with other people.Invading his privacy this way also makes you look insecure, which will undermine his desire to be in a relationship with you.  Good hints start moving you beyond the friendship stage. These can be as simple as noticing what he’s wearing or complimenting his personality. Saying, “You look cute today” suggests you have enough interest to notice him while easing him towards an escalation in your relationship.Avoid coming on too strong. Allow him feel that you’re a valuable catch he has earned.Judge his reaction. A compliment can encourage him, especially if he’s keeping his interest a secret. If he shows no reaction, go back to working on attracting him or move on.  Once your relationship starts to escalate, it’s easy to get wrapped up in the moment. You want him to be around you, so you demand more of him while exaggerating his qualities. Keep calm and stick to the plan of spending some time tending to the other aspects of your life. Accept him for who he is if you wish to make him into a boyfriend.Many people think they can change their partner inside of a relationship. If you find yourself thinking this, it’s a sign that he’s not right for you.Keep his expectations of you in line, too. Don’t be high-maintenance.  If he hasn’t already made a move, you can push the issue a little. One option is to ease him into it by asking what he would do if you were his significant other. When you’re ready to take the risk, be up front with him. Choose a quiet, intimate moment. Either come out and say it or ease him into it by starting off saying, “So I’ve been thinking…” Explain to him you want a relationship and ask him what he thinks.If he doesn’t come right out and commit, chances are his feelings aren’t strong enough.Giving him a little space after you ask can help if he’s shy or hesitant.  Sometimes he’s not right for you. It can hurt to put in this effort and find out he doesn’t share your feelings. Walk away. Don’t maintain hope, or else you’ll hurt yourself by waiting for him. Also, don’t try to force him to be with you. This only makes it less likely he’ll have feelings for you. Go on and live your life. There are plenty of boys, and maybe someday you’ll even run into this one at a better time.Remember that a good relationship is one that works for both of you. He may not be a good fit.","['Every morning, take a shower.', 'Wash your hair, brush it out, and keep it styled the way you like.', 'Put on deodorant.', 'Even if you’re already friends with the boy

Ask a good question. Be original. Be engaging. Be flirtatious. Be interesting. Know when to end the conversation. Leave him with something to think about. Don't be too needy. Don't be too eager. Don't embarrass yourself.,How to Text a Guy You Like,"Starting your texting session with a question is a great way to show you're interested in your crush and to make it easy for him to respond. He will also appreciate that you're being direct, and that you're not wasting his time with a text that he doesn't even know how to answer. Here are some ways to ask a good question:Ask him something specific about himself. This will show that you're interested in what he's been up to.Ask him something he can easily answer. Don't ask him about what he thinks is the meaning of life; ask him how he did on his math test.Be direct. He will appreciate a question that is clear and not too wordy.Ask an open-ended question. If you ask him something that he can answer in just a few words, then it will be hard to continue the conversation. Instead of saying, ""When did you get home last night?"" ask, ""How was the party last night?"" This will give him more to work with. , He will be impressed by you if you don't just send him the kind of text anyone could send. Instead of just saying hello, you can ask an interesting question, or tell him something that will make him want to respond to you and pursue the conversation further.Make him laugh. Being clever early on will make him want to make you laugh in return.Make a witty observation. This is another great way to start, as long as he knows how to answer your statement.Don't try too hard to craft the perfect opening. If you do, he will be able to tell.  You should let him know that you're able to keep up a lively conversation, and keep things open so he feels like it's easy to keep talking to you. Being engaging means not only giving the right response to him, but making it easy for him to keep the conversation going. Here's how to do it:Ask him about something he's done. He'll love to tell you more about himself. This will also show that you pay attention to the things he tells you.Be witty. Don't just say ""hahaha"" if he says something funny. This will end the conversation. Instead, fire back with something equally funny to show that you can play ball.Tell him something he's never heard before. Maybe you heard something really weird on the news, or you were impressed by a random fact. Tell him what you know and he'll ask some questions to follow up.Be playful. He'll appreciate seeing your silly side and will be silly back if you set the right tone. You can show that you're smart without taking yourself too seriously, and he will love that.  If you're at the level where you're ready to flirt, then you should have fun with him without giving your feelings away too much. Flirting will make him excited to talk to you, and he'll be impressed by your boldness as long as you don't go overboard. Here's what to do:Tease him. Don't be afraid to tease him a little bit, and to be teased back.If you're at the right stage in your relationship, let him know what you're wearing, and he'll be even more excited to see you.Send him an occasional winky face, or make a cute innuendo that lets him know you're excited to see him on your next date...and that things may get hot and heavy when you do.  If you want to keep him interested, you have to be interesting. You should show him that you're a well-rounded person with a variety of interests and friends and that you're always up to something new. He should think that you have a busy life and should feel lucky that you have time to talk to him through texting. If he feels like you spend all your time waiting around for a text from him, then he'll quickly lose interest.Show that you have a life. Let him know when you're going out with friends, taking a karate class, or watching a new movie. He'll know that your life doesn't revolve around talking to him, and will want to be a part of it even more.Find a common interest. Though you may not have time for a deep conversation when you're texting, he'll be more excited to talk to you if he finds out you like the same band or have the same favorite TV show.Mention something that you're passionate about. This will show him that you are a driven person with a variety of interests.  It's important to end things at the right time so your guy stays interested. If he's always the one to end the conversation, or if you just keep dragging the conversation on when he's busy or when there's nothing left to say, then he will leave the conversation without wanting more. Here's how to know when to end the conversation:If you're just struggling to find anything to talk about.If he's giving you one word responses, like ""Yes,"" or ""No,"" then he may not want to keep talking.If he's not asking you any questions back, then he may only be responding to you out of politeness.If he's always the one to end the conversation. Mix things up and make sure that you're the one who has to go at least half the time.  You shouldn't just end the conversation by saying, ""See ya!"" Instead, you should leave the conversation open so it will be easy for you to chat again. This can be as simple as telling him you're looking forward to seeing him, or letting him know about something interesting that you're doing so he can ask about it later. Here's how to do it:If you've already started casually seeing each other, there's no harm in letting him know that you're excited to see him.If you've started hooking up, tell him that you can't wait to show him the new lingerie you bought for your date. Leave him with a sexy image in his mind, so he'll be anticipating your new panties.Tell him where you have to go. If you're going to a concert of a band you both like, tell him so he can ask about it later.Leave an opening for him to ask you out. Casually mention that you're going out with a few friends and that it would be fun to hang out with him. If he wants to see you and isn't too shy, he may ask.  The last thing a guy wants is a girl who is too needy. If you're already showing signs that you're needy over texts, then he will have no doubt that you're even needier in person. Your texts should be fun and breezy, and should not make him feel like you want something from him. Here's what not to do:Don't ever say, ""Did you get my text?"" Unless his phone was stolen, then yes, he got your text, and he didn't feel like answering. Don't make the situation more uncomfortable than it needs to be.You can ask about his weekend, but don't ask if he hooked up with another girl, or if he saw any cute girls out at the bar last night. This will just make you look jealous, and a little creepy.Don't send him a question mark if he doesn't respond to your text. This will make him feel like you're breathing over his shoulder and that you're desperate to hear from him.  Your texts should let your guy know that you're into him, and that you're a cool chick to talk to. Your texts should not make the guy feel like you're obsessing over talking to him and that you're at his back and call and are willing to put your life on hold to respond to him. Here are some things you should not do to avoid looking too eager:Don't say, ""You there?"" if he hasn't responded in five minutes.Don't text him twice or three times in a row. Wait for him to respond first.Don't respond too quickly. You don't want it to look like you're just waiting around for a text from him. If he's taken four hours to respond to you, don't fire back an answer as soon as you hear from him. Take six hours to respond to him — or even seven.Don't keep the conversation going when he clearly wants to stop. If he's only giving you one word answers, or barely answering, lay off.Don't use too many emoticons. The occasional winky face or smiley face will let him know you're flirting, but a million exclamation marks or smiley faces will scare him off.Don't text him when you're supposed to be having fun. If you're out with your girlfriends or at a party, you can send him the occasional text to let him know you're thinking of him, but don't make him think that you don't know how to have fun because you're too busy being tied to your phone.  The last thing you want to do when you're texting a guy you like is to completely embarrass yourself. Once you embarrass yourself through your texts, it may be hard to strike up a conversation again, and even harder to build a relationship with the person you like. Here are some things you should not do:Avoid revealing how you really feel about him. Texting is the time to be cute and to further your relationship. It's not the time to pour your heart out. This is something you can do in person, once the time is right. Telling him how much you like him via text will make you look a bit desperate and afraid of having a real conversation in person.Don't text him nine times in a row with your deep feelings. If he has stepped away from the phone for a while and returns to a filled inbox, he will just be freaked out.Do not send him nude photos. Even if your relationship has progressed and you've had some sexy time, this is the stupidest thing you can do. Not only may he think you're too forward, but if you don't know him that well, he can end up being a creep and may hold it against you later.","[""Starting your texting session with a question is a

Make eye contact—and then break it. Smile. Turn your body toward your crush. Move closer to him. Break the touch barrier. Look your best. Become friends. Don’t show off. Give him a small gift. Ask him questions to show that you care. Tease him. Help him out. Flirt with him. Don’t have your friends tell him. Write him a note or a letter. Call him. Just tell him in person. React appropriately.,How to Tell Your Crush You Like Him Without Words,"One way to let your crush see that you like him without opening your mouth is to simply lock eyes with him. Make eye contact for just one or two seconds—just enough time to show you’re paying attention—and then look down at the floor or just avert your gaze. This will show your crush that you like him without being too obvious; if you simply stare at him, that may be coming on too strong.You can try this trick just one or two times when you’re in the same room together, whether you’re at a party or in class. Just try to be subtle about it; you don’t want him to catch you staring too many times!You can even give him a small flirtatious smile to go along with the look. , You don’t need to give your crush an ear-to-ear grin to show him that you’re interested. Simply look at him, give him a small smile, and then look away or start a conversation with him. Your smile shouldn’t be too big or eager, or he may just think you’re being friendly; instead, try to be a little bit mysterious when you smile at him, so you play coy while letting him know you’re interested.If you really want to up your flirtation factor, you can even learn to smile with your eyes.  Another way to let your crush know you like him is through some simple open body language. If your body is “open,” that means that you’re standing tall, face your crush, turn your feet and shoulders toward him, and keep your arms out instead of crossed over your chest. This shows your crush that you’re interested in him and that you like being around him. The next time you’re standing next to him or sitting next to him, make sure you’re turning your body in his direction so he sees that you like him.For example, if you’re talking to him and cross your legs, make sure your crossed leg is crossed toward him, not away, so you have more of an open posture.  Another way to show your crush that you like him is to simply move a bit closer to him, whether you’re talking to him or just hanging out at the same party. You don’t need to be too forward or start close-talking or making him uncomfortable, but you should show him that you like him by simply gravitating toward him in social situations. Without being clingy, you can show your crush that you like him simply by paying a bit more attention than you do to other guys by standing next to him, sitting by him, or making sure you get a chance to chat when you’re in a small group.When you do talk to him, you can make an effort to stand a bit closer or to sit a bit closer to him as the conversation progresses. If he doesn’t move away but moves toward you, then this may be a sign that he returns your feelings.  If you want to tell your crush you like him without blurting it out completely, one thing you can do is to give him a light touch or two. If you’re talking to him or pass by him, you can give him a light touch on the shoulder or upper arm, or even playfully swat his arm if he’s teasing you. If you’re standing or sitting next to him, you can casually let your feet or knees touch from time to time to show him that you want to get closer.Just a bit of physical attention will let your crush know that you like him. You don’t need to push it too far; just touching him once or twice during a conversation will show him that you like him.  Now, this doesn’t mean that you have to dress to the nines or put on a ton of makeup to get your crush’s attention. However, it does mean that you should look and feel beautiful, fresh, and clean when you talk to your crush; putting an effort into your appearance will give you a boost of confidence, and it will also show your crush that you want to make a good impression on him. Make sure to wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and not to pretend to be someone you’re not.If you’re hanging out with your crush and just a small group of people, dressing up will show him that you’ve put some thought into how you look for him, which may indicate that you do have a crush on him.  One way to show the guy you like him is to try to be his friend. As long as you don’t get into the friend zone, this will show that you’re taking a real interest in him. Ask him questions about his life, share his interests, and just spend some time around him, whether you’re working on a group project or hanging out with friends. Just make sure he doesn’t see you as a kid sister or one of the guys, and don’t fall into the role of the person who hears about his romantic troubles.Becoming his friend will show him that you want to get closer to him. This can be a great way to show him you like him, especially if you don’t have many other guy friends.Take it slow. If you don’t know him very well, start with a simple conversation and work your way up to hanging out.  If you want to tell your crush you like him, then you should show him that you’re comfortable being yourself around him. If you find yourself bragging, talking about how great you are, telling exaggerated stories for laughs, or just doing something that doesn’t feel like you, then this won’t win your crush over. He’ll be more likely to think you have a real interest in him if you’re being yourself, opening up, and talking about your interests or your friends.Remember that, in the end, you want a guy who likes you for who you are. You don’t want him to like you for being someone else, because that will make it hard to start a real relationship while staying true to who you are.  A small gift can be a simple way to show your crush that you like him without coming on too strong. Simply get him something he’s mentioned or something you think he would like, such as a book or a CD. You can also be silly and get him something more practical, like a pack of pencils because you noticed that he never remembers to bring a pencil to class. You can write him a short note along with the gift and give it to him in person or leave it on his desk.Of course, this works best if you know him and are already friends; if you’ve never met, then giving him a gift may overwhelm him a little.  One way to tell your crush you like him is to show a genuine interest in him. To do this, you should simply ask him questions about his life and make an effort to really listen to the answers instead of planning your next move. Ask him about his weekend plans, his favorite sports teams, his school activities, his friends, or his favorite bands or movie stars to get a conversation going; this will show that you care about him as a person, and that you may have a little crush on him as well.You can also ask him about his pets, his favorite movies, or his favorite things to do for fun.Just make sure not to ask too many personal questions at first or he may get uncomfortable.Make sure to share stuff about yourself too; you don’t want to sound like you’re interrogating him.  Your crush will start to see that you like him if you start teasing him a bit. You don’t need to lay it on too thick to get the message across; just playfully tease him about his new haircut, his favorite sports team (especially if the team keeps losing), his obsession with his favorite band, or other things you know he won’t take too personally. This shows that you like him enough to engage him in a fun, lighthearted conversation.Just make sure he knows you’re teasing and that he takes it well. He may be too sensitive about his favorite sports team, for example, to think there’s anything funny about the fact that they keep losing.Let him see that you don’t tease just anybody. If he thinks that you tease all of his friends, too, then he won’t see that he’s special to you.  Your crush will suspect that you like him if you start helping him out. You don’t need to go too far out of your way to help him, but making just a few small gestures can show him that you really do have a special interest in him. This can mean picking up his homework for him when he’s home sick, letting him borrow a textbook, or answering some questions that he may have. This can be a great way to show him you care as long as he doesn’t take advantage of you.Ideally, he should find a way to help you out, too. You don’t want him to think that you’ll just be there at his beck and call.Look for ways that you can help him; he may be too shy to do something like ask for him with the math homework, but you can offer to do it and see what he says.  Flirting will definitely let your crush know that you’re into him. To flirt with him, you just have to tease him a bit, be playful, and show a special interest in him over all of the other guys in the room. You can play a little bit hard to get while letting him see that you do like him by smiling at him, laughing at his jokes, and going out of your way to make him see that you want to spend more time with him.Flirting can be a little tricky to master, but it basically means not taking yourself too seriously while you chat about lighthearted topics with your crush, letting him see that you want to know what he has to say while also teasing him a little bit.You can lick your lips or play with your hair a bit while you talk to your crush to be a bit more playful.  If you do want your crush to know how much you like him, you should make sure to tell him yourself, even if you do it in a letter. While having your friends tell your crush how you feel may be easier, it will make you look like you’re not ready for a mature relationship or like you don’t feel comfortable talking to him yourself. Even if he does say that he likes you back, this won’t start your relationship off on the right foot.Plus, you don’t want him to feel annoyed by all of your friends surrounding him; respect his privacy and tell him about your feelings yourself.  If you’re too afraid to tell your crush you like him in person, then one thing you can do is to write him a short note or a longer letter letting him know how you feel. You can slide it into his locker or hand it to him. Tell him that you like him, give him a reason or two why if you want, and ask if he returns your feelings. This is a great way to directly tell him how you feel while taking off some of the pressure of having to do it in person.Keep it short and sweet. You don’t want to go into too much detail about how you like him without knowing whether or not he returns your feelings.You can tell him the best way to contact you, either by telling him where he can leave his response or by giving him your number.  Another way to tell him that you like him is to give him a call and simply to tell him how you feel. Yeah, this technically means telling him how you feel with words, but if you find that telling him without words hasn’t been working for you, then it may be time to come out with it. Give him a call, take a deep breath, and quickly tell him how you feel and ask him if he returns your feelings. You’ll have your answer before you know it.Just say something like, “I’ve had a lot of fun hanging out with you for the past few weeks, and I want you to know that I like you. I wanted to know if you shared my feelings.”, If the idea of calling him to tell him your feelings doesn’t feel quite right, then you may just have to pick the right time and place to have the conversation in person. Just ask him if he can meet you in a place where you can be alone, make eye contact, and simply tell him how you feel. Give him some time to react and respond and try not to put the pressure on him; keep things lighthearted instead of sounding intense.You can make a bit of small talk to make him comfortable, but don’t be afraid to jump in and share your feelings.You can give him a small compliment or two while you say that you like him. You can say something like, “Nobody can make me laugh like you can” to show why you like him.  Once your crush knows you like him, he’ll either say he shares your feelings or will want to stay friends. If he says he likes you too, then you can celebrate and get excited to start a relationship with him. If he doesn’t feel the same way, however, it’s important to stay mature and to keep things positive instead of getting emotional or making him feel bad for not feeling the same way. Though you will be upset, you should make it seem like it’s not a big deal and then be sad about it once you’re away from your crush.No matter what happens, you want to leave a good impression. If you start calling him names or being mean to him for not sharing your feelings, that will take you down a dark path.Even if he doesn’t share your feelings, he’ll respect you for being open and honest with him. You should be proud of yourself for putting yourself out there and making an effort.","['One way to let your crush see that you like him without opening your mouth is to simply lock eyes with him.', 'Make eye contact for just one or two seconds—just enough time to show you’re paying attention—and then look down at the floor or just avert your gaze.', 'This will show your crush that you like him without being too obvious;

Pay attention to what he does. Catch him if he takes frequent glances in your direction. Check for smiles. Consider whether he has tried to talk to you or followed you. Notice if he laughs or talks about random things around you. Watch for a constant need to butt in. Consider whether he is always making an excuse to talk to your friends. Notice where he sits. Notice if you see him frequently all of the sudden. Consider competitiveness as a possible sign of liking you. Watch for him asking you to be his study buddy. Watch how he responds when you are with another guy. Give him the death glare.,How to Tell if a Guy in Middle School Likes You,"Does he try to touch you? Even just little touches relatively frequently could indicate he likes you.Do you ever find him poking you or tickling you? If so, this is called flirting 101! Touch is a useful way to tell if a guy likes you, because guys flirt with girls they don't even like all the time, depending on who they are. So if he tickles or touches you, he is obviously flirting. , Looking sheepish or pretending to think every time you catch him looking at you is a sign of interest. Do you ever glance over at him and catch him staring at you? If you do, there is hope that he likes you. But it also depends on how often you catch him looking or how long you do. Don't give up yet!If you catch him looking at you every day in every class, multiple times for more than three seconds, you're in luck! Usually if he likes you he will stare a you for a bit and not lose eye contact after a few seconds and will continuously do it.If you catch him looking at you for a couple seconds but he looks away, this is still a good sign, as long as he does it more than once.If he only looks at you for a second but turns away during one class, he probably has no feelings for you. He is probably just looking around.If he looks away and smiles, this could mean he likes you.If he keeps looking and laughs after, this could also mean he likes you.  If he is smiling at you a lot, this is a great sign of fondness.  It is a positive sign if the guy you like tells a lot of jokes near you. Usually this means that the guy wants to be near you. Also, notice if he is near members of your group in science class for example, and he all of the sudden talks to them a lot. This means he wants to get an excuse to get closer to you.  If a guy really likes you, he will usually try to find ways to talk to you, even goofy ways.Remember that guys often have a hard time talking to girls because they're nervous. If he stutters or gives awkward replies, it could be a sign that he likes you.  Do you ever find him butting into your conversations with a friend? This could mean he is trying to spark a conversation with you and wants to talk. Let him! Joke around a bit to let him know you accept him.  Is he coming up often and talking to your friends but not necessarily you? He may be working his way around to you, and using your friends as the excuse to be near.  If he sits beside you or somewhere close and then tries to talk to you, this is a good sign.  If he starts showing up where ever you are, he may be following you to find a good time to talk to you.  Have you ever found him trying to race or compete with you in gym class? This is also an obvious way to tell if guys like you. He will probably try to catch up with you and give you sarcastic comments that make you want to beat him. This competitiveness will be a great way to show him what you got and flirt at the same time.  Asking you to be his partner in class or to come over and study could mean he likes you (or it could mean he is picking your brains for his assignment, so do be careful here). Furthermore, if you decline and he later denies having anything to do with asking you, he may be interested.For example: If there is a math problem that he couldn't do, or any other example, and he gets up and comes to you even if he could have gotten the answer from someone else, such as his best friend, this is an indication that he likes you.  If he overreacts when you spend time with another guy, it might be a sign of his interest in you. Beware though, if he's a controlling type, an overreaction is not a sign of affection but one of control.Does he ever get angry or upset when you are talking to or are fooling around with other boys? Does he give you looks? This could mean that he is jealous! This is also another obvious way to tell if he likes you. By seeing another guy with you, he wishes it could be him talking and laughing to you.  You can often find out if a guy likes you by looking him straight in the eyes and asking him if he likes you. If he blushes, smiles slightly, or says nothing, this could mean he likes you.

Notice if he spends time messaging you. Look for him to respond to your messages quickly. Analyze the quality of messages he sends. Look for signs of flirting. Don’t draw conclusions from one interaction.,How to Tell if a Boy Likes You on the Internet1,"A guy who likes you online will often make time to talk and message with you. For instance, he might message you frequently even when you are offline. You may also find that you spend hours messaging back and forth throughout the day and even into the night. This is a sign that he likes talking to you and is making time in his schedule to communicate.  If you send a message to him and he takes over an hour to respond and you know that he is online, this likely means that he is just being polite. Alternatively, if he messages back right away and then starts up a conversation he probably likes you.Similarly, a guy who likes you will often message you as soon as you log onto Facebook messenger or any other messaging app.  Some guys will respond to your messages just because they are polite. If this is the case, they will likely respond with short, one word answers and will rarely try and engage in a meaningful conversation. Alternatively, if a boy likes you, he will try to get to know you, ask your advice or opinion, or share stories about his day.If he is interested he might say ""how was your day?"" or ""what are you up to this weekend?"" These types of questions reveal that he wants to be apart of your everyday life.  Boys will often flirt when they like someone. Signs of online flirting include compliments, light hearted jokes, the use of exclamation points, emoticons, or bitmojis.He might say something like ""you look so cute in your profile picture."", Never pin all your hopes or fears on just one or two online conversations. Lots of people run their instant messengers in the background whether they have the time to chat or not. His short responses may just signal that he is busy or preoccupied.If this becomes a regular pattern, it may be a sign that he is not interested in you.","['A guy who likes you online will often make time to talk and message with you.', 'For instance, he might message you frequently even when you are offline.', 'You may also find that you spend hours messaging back and forth throughout the day and even into the night.', 'This is a sign that he likes talking to you and is making time in his schedule to communicate.', 'If you send a message to him and he takes over an hour to respond and you know that he is online, this likely means that he is just being polite.', 'Alternatively, if he messages back right away and then starts up a conversation he probably likes you.', 'Similarly, a guy who likes you will often message you as soon as you log onto Facebook messenger or any other messaging app.', 'Some guys will respond to your messages just because they are polite.', 'If this is the case, they will likely respond with short, one word answers and will rarely try and engage in a meaningful conversation.', 'Alternatively, if a boy likes you, he will try to get to know you, ask your advice or opinion, or share stories about his day.', 'If he is interested he might say ""how was your day?"" or ""what are you up to this weekend?""', 'These types of questions reveal that he wants to be apart of your everyday life.', 'Boys will often flirt when they like someone.', 'Signs of online flirting include compliments, light hearted jokes, the use of exclamation points, emoticons, or bitmojis.', 'He might say something like ""you look so cute in your profile picture."", Never pin all your hopes or fears on just one or two online conversations.', 'Lots of people run their instant messengers in the background whether they have the time to chat or not.', 'His short responses may just signal that he is busy or preoccupied.', 'If this becomes a regular pattern, it may be a sign that he is not interested in you.']"
"Give him some signs. Find a good time. Talk to him in private. Be bold. Say it - it's simple. Use his interests. Use a song. Make him a present. Write him a letter. Make a video. Don't pressure him. Don't be creepy. Don't use social media or a phone. Don't rush into things. Don't sweat rejection. Ask him out, if he returns your feelings. Look for good guys.",How to Tell Your Crush You Like Him,"You should always give your guy the opportunity to realize for himself that you like him so that he can do something about it if he wants to. Be a little flirty and be sure to spend time with him. Try to introduce little touches and other hints. Just don't drag this on too long!Try biting your lip every time he looks at you or smile nervously. Look into his eyes and then turn away slowly. , It's important to choose a good time to talk. You don't want him to be distracted, upset about something else, or just downright busy! That will kill your chances before you even get started. Talk to him about setting aside some good time to talk, or try to catch him at a time when you know he won't be busy.  Talk to him in private. Confessing your crush in front of other people will make him feel pressured and embarrassed, and you don't want that! People that feel cornered can be unwilling to admit how they really feel. Instead, get him on his own so that the two of you can have a real heart-to-heart.  When confessing your feelings, you have to just get out there and say how you feel. Be confident! Guys will think this is sexy. You also have to be bold because you're going to need to take the initiative in talking about how you feel and whether the two of you could have anything.  The most basic way to confess your crush is to just come right out and say it. This can take courage, but generally people will appreciate your honesty and will be flattered by your bravery. This avoids gimmicks and shows how much you really think they're worth. Here are some examples of how to say it:""Hey, Brian. I thought you deserved to know that I have very strong feelings for you. You don't have to return my feelings, but I thought it was only right for you to know.""""Michael: you're special. You're kind, smart, and funny and I am so much happier when you're around. I want us to be more than friends. I hope you see, like I do, that we could be something really great."", Use his interests in order to confess your feelings. You can use this simply to give yourself an opening (for example, by going rock climbing with him) or you can use it to confess in a unique way (for example, by inviting him over and having the Han Solo/Princess Leia flirt scene queued up on your TV).  You probably don't remember what mixtapes are, but using songs to confess feelings is still a viable option.Find a song you know he'll love. Ask to borrow a USB drive from him to transfer a file from a school/work computer to your personal computer. Leave the mp3 of the song on the USB, specially named so he'll know: ""MIKE - Tessa Wants to Hold Your Hand"" or some other reference to the song.Good song options include: ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" by the Beatles, Frank Sinatra's ""Let's Fall In Love"", or Daft Punk's ""Digital Love"".  You can make him a present to confess your feelings. Try to tailor it to your crush, and if you two were already friends try to use it to remind him of the wonderful times you've had together.Paint a small wooden box with both of your initials in a heart, and fill the box with pics of the two of you hanging out, stubs from movies you saw together, or other reminders of fun things you've done together.Put together a relaxation care package, with two movie tickets, two bags of candy, and a message something like, ""I know you had a hard time with finals last week. I'd love the chance to wind down with you. If you're not interested, no worries! Take whoever you want...but I'd love the chance to make you laugh until you forget what quadratic polynomials are."", There's nothing more romantic than some old-fashioned letter writing. Write him a letter telling him how you feel and put it in his locker or (if you know his address) mail it to his house. You can also leave it in a place where you know he'll find it, like in his books or his desk.Spritz it with a bit of your perfume to make it extra exciting.  Make a YouTube video confessing your crush (you probably shouldn't mention him by name). Tell him how you feel and why. Then email or text him a QR code with the link to the video. You can also print out the code and put it in is locker or tape it inside his textbook.  Don't break right out into the ""I love you""s and don't talk about the future you want the two of you to have. You want to avoid speaking in definite terms about the future because this creates a lot of pressure and expectations for him...which is stressful and can scare him away!Instead, speak in terms of what you want to try or what you hope might become real eventually. ""I hope we can try being more than friends,"", etc.  Don't be creepy when you tell him how you feel. This means no begging, no bargaining, and try not to touch him or get into his personal space until you know he feels the same way. You also shouldn't cling around him if he needs time to think about what you said.  If you can, tell him how you feel in person. Using social media or a text can come across as not being very serious or, worse, being a joke. This is not how you want to start things with him.  You don't want to rush into telling him and if he returns your feelings, don't rush into a serious relationship. If you're going to go through the torture of confessing, you want to be sure that you really like him first, right? This is can be a long process and one that will continue even if you start dating.Just focus on getting to know him for who he really is, by spending time with him and talking about things that are important to you: what you both want for the future, what your beliefs are, and what you like to do for fun.  Don't worry about being rejected. It can feel awful to be rejected, but in a few years you probably won't remember it at all. Remember: it's his loss. You don't want to be with someone that doesn't like you as much as you like them anyway. You deserve better than that!, If he does return your feelings, make sure to actually ask him out if he doesn't ask you out! You shouldn't feel bad about making your intentions clear or taking initiative like this: sometimes it's necessary to get what you want out of life! With feelings confessed, asking him out is as simple as coming up with an idea for a date and taking things from there. Just ask!, If you strike out with him or if he's a real jerk about rejecting you, you might want to take a look at the kinds of guys you find yourself interested in.

Notice if he wants to learn more about you. Ask if he wants to meet you in person. Be direct and ask if he likes you. See if he takes down his online dating profile.,How to Tell if a Boy Likes You on the Internet3,"If a boy you met online likes you, he will likely want to get to know you better. Does he ask you questions about your life? If he responds and engages with your answers, it may be a sign that he likes you.He might ask about your job, hobbies, and family in an attempt to get to know you better. Showing an interest in your life is a sign that he likes you.That being said, if he asks you really personal but irrelevant questions, like what your address is or whether or not you’re home alone, he might have other motives.  If he asks you to meet up for coffee or go on a date, that is a tell-tale sign that he likes you and wants to get to know you better. Some guys are shy or timid and may not ask to meet up. If you are interested in him, take the initiative and say ""do you want to grab a drink sometime?"" If he responds quickly and enthusiastically, it may mean that he likes you too.Alternatively, he may say ""Sure, just let me check my schedule."" If he never gets back to you with his availability he is probably not interested.  After awhile it may become tedious trying to pick up on signals to see if he has feelings for you. You can always try and be direct and simply ask him how he feels about you. You could say ""I feel like we have a really good connection and I am starting to develop feelings for you. Do you feel the same?"" This way you will get straight to the point and you can stop guessing about his feelings and intentions.  Once you have met and gone on a couple dates, you may be wondering if this is actually going anywhere. One way to see if he likes you is to check if he has removed his online dating profile.

"Remind yourself how confident you should be. Continue flirting with him. Break the touch barrier, if you haven't already. Plan a special day together. While on your date or excursion, keep the conversation up and the flirting going. Right before you ask him, go through your checklist. Go out and tell him. Wait for his response. Plan the next date.","How to Tell a Guy You Like Him, when He Likes You Too","If you know for a fact that the guy you like likes you back, that should give you all the confidence in the world. Most people aren't sure at all, or maybe have a hunch. So act confident, because confidence is attractive. It will make a difference.Before you ask him, tell yourself that you already have the hardest part under control: You've gotten him to like you. Now you just have to act on that attraction. This gets easier as time goes on. The hardest part is the first time you tell him; everything after that is a downhill ride. , Giving him hints might even cause him to be more confident and act on his attraction and ask you out!Compliment him about something he does well, but teasingly. This will come off flirty and won't bother him because he won't be insecure about something he's really good at:""If I would have known that you'd single-handedly destroy the other football team, I wouldn't have come. I like a little excitement, okay?!""Tell him how much you appreciate him. Being a little sarcastic is good, but being sincere is even better:""Hey, thanks for helping me out with that birthday celebration. You make a pretty great friend. Always stay that way.""Pick him up when he's down. He might not show it the same way that other people show it, but try to recognize when he's not feeling his best:""Don't worry about Felix, okay? He's a jerk and he knows it. Don't let it hurt your confidence. You're way better than him anyway."", Chances are you're gotten close enough to him that you're experimented a little with touching him in safe places. If you've already done that, great. If you haven't, try some of these little tricks to communicate your affection before you actually come out and say it.Learn to touch his hand, arm, and shoulder. When you're making a point, reach over and casually touch his hand. When you're reminding him of something or trying to be really serious, touch his arm or the back of his shoulder. It should send shivers down his spine.Hang or rest on his shoulder. Pretend to be bored and rest your head on his shoulder. Or simply rest your hands on his shoulder. Give him a good look in his eyes if he looks back at you.  This could be a date, or something that you guys regularly do, like walk to the corner store for a soda. He doesn't have to know that it's a date, but if he asks whether it's a date, tell him you'd want it to be. That will tell a guy that you like him without actually going out and saying it.You can try something like:""Hey, my dad got me these two tickets for a movie on Saturday, but my best friend bailed, so I was wondering if you wanted to be an even-better friend and come with me?""""I've been meaning to go on this hike past Malibu for ages and I need a hiking partner. Are you doing anything on Sunday?"", This is for building rapport, or chemistry. You don't want to just blurt out that you like him. You want to slowly build up to it, waiting for just the right moment.Talk about things that he likes talking about, for example. Build up chemistry by asking him questions about subjects that he's enthusiastic about. Once he gets going, the conversation should really begin to flow, and you probably won't have to do all that much talking.Talk about funny things. Laughter is great for chemistry. Tell inside jokes that you only share with him. Gently tease him, remembering to touch him on the arm or shoulder. Just be silly with him; ask him to give you a piggyback ride, or get him to do an impression of one of your teachers.  Make sure you have a couple of crucial things under control right before you ask him. If you're in a public place, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom for a moment. While you're there, check:That your breath smells nice. If he swoops in for a kiss, you want to be ready. Pop a mint into your mouth.That your hair and makeup looks great. Touch up your lips with a little balm (not gloss and definitely not lipstick) and make sure you're looking your best.That you're confident. If you have no confidence, it's best to wait until you can ask him with confidence. Don't worry though, you have no reason to worry!, Wait for the right moment and just come out with it. Maybe wait until the end of the date, so there's no awkwardness after you confess your feelings, and he does his. Here's a couple different options.Short and sweet: ""Maybe you've already noticed this, but I really like you. I was hoping you felt the same and we could do this again next weekend.""Long and heartfelt: ""This is really hard to do but I need to do it. Ever since we've become friends, I started liking you. It came slow at first. And then I noticed how funny you are, and it came a little more. When I really started having conversations with you, I felt it even more. And right now, right here, I feel it most of all."", You've given him the perfect opportunity to open up to you, and he better take it. You should be getting a really nice, or even romantic response from him. Remember to smile and look at his eyes. This should give him the confidence to kiss you, but if he doesn't, don't worry.  Maybe he'll just plan the next date automatically after you tell him how you feel. If so, that's great. Still, he might need a little nudging. In that case, say something like:""So I was thinking that we could do something like this again sometime. Because I set this one up, will you set the next one up? I'm really easy to please, I promise. I'm a sucker for movies, walks on the beach, or shopping. But I also like to be surprised!""","['If you know for a fact that the guy you like likes you back, that should give you all the confidence in the world.', ""Most people aren't sure at all, or maybe have a hunch."", 'So act confident, because confidence is attractive.', 'It will make a difference.', ""Before you ask him, tell yourself that you already have the hardest part under control: You've gotten him to like you."", 'Now you just have to act on that attraction.', 'This gets easier as time goes on.', 'The hardest part is the first time you tell him;

"Hang out around this boy more often. Try to find ways to get together. Consider taking up an after-school activity that you know he does. Find out what possibilities exist outside of school time. Use the time spent together to gauge both how you feel about him and whether you think he shows signs of interest in you. Talk to your friends. Consider talking to one of his friends. Be sure that he's worth the effort. Choose a time when other people aren't around. Rehearse telling him. Allow your crush the space to reply in his own way and at his pace. Realize that you may be rejected. If he says he likes you too, celebrate.",How to Tell a Middle School Boy You Like Him,"It's important to get to know each other before deciding that this guy is worth shattering your nerves for and telling him you like him!;, If you're in class, sit close to him or even next to him. Try to get into his activity groups or other exercises. In sport, get on his team where possible or play in pairs or alongside of him. If you're not in the same class, catch him at his locker and say hello or spend time with him and his friends during lunch and recess.  Of course, only do this if the activity also interests you, otherwise it's a waste of your time. This can provide a great way for him to get to know you better, and vice versa.  Can you ask a bunch of friends back to your place that will also include him? Can you go somewhere he's likely to be spending time, such as at the mall, a sports field or hanging downtown? Find out what is possible and won't put you in any difficult positions with your parents.  This will help you to make the decision about telling him that you like him and to ask him on a date.  Ask them what they think about your prospects with this guy and how they interpret his reactions toward you at the moment. Often people outside of a crush will have more objectivity and may be able to see the signs––or lack of them––that you can't quite put your finger on. Always talk to trusted friends, who will keep your confidence.  Try to find out carefully whether your crush already has a love interest or might have any interest in you. Do your best to avoid making your interest too obvious unless you want them to relay it straight back to him. If in doubt, skip his friends and only talk to yours.  You are going to put yourself out on a limb without knowing how he'll respond yet, so he had better be worth it!, This gives both of you wriggle room to back out and to say what you really feel without others overhearing and possibly spreading rumors. This might be at the end of lunch, after school or when you're alone at the lockers. Scout out possible good times and places a few days before you decide to tell him.Avoid the temptation to text, IM or email him with this news. It is definitely something that should be passed on personally, face-to-face.  While you need to be ready to go with the flow and react to his reactions when you actually tell him, it can't hurt to rehearse your opening lines with him. For example:""Hey Josh, have you got a moment? There's something I wanted to talk to you about."" Josh says yes, so you proceed: ""I wanted to tell you that I'm really enjoying spending time with you and that I like you a lot. I was hoping you might want to hang out with me this weekend.""""Hey Hank, we've been great friends for a while now and I have grown to really like you. Would you be interested in coming to the movies with me this Friday?""""So Zack, I just wanted to let you know something that matters to me a lot. It's that I really like you. I was hoping you might feel the same way too."", This is probably not news to him but it is out in the open now, instead of hanging in the air between you two. If there is a long silence, you could interject that you just wanted to get that out there and that he doesn't have to say anything straight away, that you're happy for him to think about it for a time.  This is not necessarily the end of things but it may happen and isn't a reflection on you as a person.

Sort out your feelings for him. Ask yourself how well you know each other. Spend more time getting to know him before making up your mind. Consider spending more time around him even if he has his girlfriend by his side. Try to use social media in order to communicate with him whilst his girlfriend is not around. Talk as much as possible. Ask about his relationship––with care. Reflect on your feelings again. Pluck up the courage. Decide how to tell him. Be honest. Start by talking to him in a normal way. See how he responds. Be prepared. Let go.,How to Tell a Guy Who Has a Girlfriend That You Like Him,"Do you only like him because he is taken, or do you genuinely like him? Do you think it would change anything if you told him how you feel about him?;, How well do you get along? Try to find reasons as to why you like him so much. You need to understand your feelings, to allow you to make the correct decision and to be able to express them in a confident way.  Follow the next section before deciding that it's okay to tell him your true feelings. By spending more time with him, you'll get to know him better, he'll grow to trust you more and maybe, just maybe, he might see things differently too.  Show interest in his social life and hang around with friends he hangs around with. This shows a guy that you are confident enough to spend break times with his own friends at times in an outgoing manner.  It is uncomfortable to speak to a guy you really like in front of his girlfriend who might easily realize your interest in her guy and become jealous. Start a conversation on Facebook to get around this. For instance, while he is online, ask him simple questions like how he's doing and how did he do in an exam.Go for questions like, ""what's your favourite food?"" or ""what movies do you like most?"". This helps you learn more about him and in doing so, you keep your conversation going while also showing him you care.  If your conversations are a bit stuck in the same discourse, then try to find ways to make them interesting. Don't always start the conversation with ""hey"" or ""hi there"". Instead, find out what his favorite subject is and try to find a picture, a joke or a quote which is related to that. Then you can pass it on, with an excuse that ""you might like this"" or that ""this reminded me of you"". This shows a guy that you remember what he tells you.  If it seems appropriate, try to offer advice in case of some ups and downs that they may be having. Even if you actually think of hitting her in the face often for having the guy you are crazy about, showing interest in their relationship gets him to trust you with his personal issues while it also acts as a key to discovering what he likes and what he doesn't like in his relationship.  After doing all of this, some time should have passed by and by then you can figure out if what you feel towards him is a strong feeling or just something temporary. If you notice that these are recurring feelings which are only becoming stronger by time; it's time to face the music and let him know how you feel. The main question is how ?!, If you've decided that it's worth telling him, then it's time to give it a try. You must be confident with yourself and with what you feel in order to express yourself correctly and clearly. Do not hesitate or fear that you will end up being rejected. On the bright side, if that happens you would have figured out what he truly feels towards you and can hence, move on without thinking what could have been.  The best way to tell him is face to face; however, with his girlfriend around, that might not always be ideal. So a text message or a message via Facebook can help you get what you want to tell him across.  When you are dealing with feelings, honesty really is the best policy. Don't lie to him about it, just come right out and tell him.Be considerate. Your crush has a girlfriend. Remember that she has feelings too. If you're friends with her, tell her too. You don't want to ruin your friendship with her.  Then include something like, ""I was wondering the other day and I have something to tell you..."". When he responds ""yeah go on, I'm listening"", tell him the truth. Don't talk in a very hyperbolic way because it might scare him. Let him know that you are aware about his girlfriend but still you wanted to let him know even if nothing will change after this moment, at least you confronted him with confidence.Say something like ""We've been speaking for the past few weeks/months now and I have gotten to know more about you. Honestly, the thing is, I like you, I really do. And I know that you have a girlfriend but still I wanted you to know."", This will determine the type of response that you give to him.If it's just an ""okay"" or ""thanks"", say: ""I'm relieved now that I told you"" .If he answers back in a long paragraph with the fact that he has a girlfriend and other excuses, just say ""It's okay, I wanted to be honest and I understand that you have a girlfriend. I'm okay with that"".If you get the answer you've been hoping for ""I like you too"", just go ahead and carry on your conversation to see how things can unfold between you.  If he already has a girlfriend, then you're likely to be rejected. Don't take it personally and remember that if he said he would break up with his girlfriend for you, then consider whether he's the type of guy you would want to be with. If that happens, then get over him.  Letting him know how you feel sets peace to your mind because no matter what the answer might be, you'll know you would have let him know whatever you wanted him to know. However, never force him into liking you or into leaving his girlfriend for you. After all, you definitely rather be his first choice rather than his second !","['Do you only like him because he is taken, or do you genuinely like him?', 'Do you think it would change anything if you told him how you feel about him?;, How well do you get along?', 'Try to find reasons as to why you like him so much.', 'You need to understand your feelings, to allow you to make the correct decision and to be able to express them in a confident way.', ""Follow the next section before deciding that it's okay to tell him your true feelings."", ""By spending more time with him, you'll get to know him better, he'll grow to trust you more and maybe, just maybe, he might see things differently too."", 'Show interest in his social life and hang around with friends he hangs around with.', 'This shows a guy that you are confident enough to spend break times with his own friends at times in an outgoing manner.', 'It is uncomfortable to speak to a guy you really like in front of his girlfriend who might easily realize your interest in her guy and become jealous.', 'Start a conversation on Facebook to get around this.', ""For instance, while he is online, ask him simple questions like how he's doing and how did he do in an exam."", 'Go for questions like, ""what\'s your favourite food?""', 'or ""what movies do you like most?"".', 'This helps you learn more about him and in doing so, you keep your conversation going while also showing him you care.', 'If your conversations are a bit stuck in the same discourse, then try to find ways to make them interesting.', 'Don\'t always start the conversation with ""hey"" or ""hi there"".', 'Instead, find out what his favorite subject is and try to find a picture, a joke or a quote which is related to that.', 'Then you can pass it on, with an excuse that ""you might like this"" or that ""this reminded me of you"".', 'This shows a guy that you remember what he tells you.', 'If it seems appropriate, try to offer advice in case of some ups and downs that they may be having.', ""Even if you actually think of hitting her in the face often for having the guy you are crazy about, showing interest in their relationship gets him to trust you with his personal issues while it also acts as a key to discovering what he likes and what he doesn't like in his relationship."", 'After doing all of this, some time should have passed by and by then you can figure out if what you feel towards him is a strong feeling or just something temporary.', ""If you notice that these are recurring feelings which are only becoming stronger by time;

Remember your past moments of clumsiness and relax.,How to Make Friends with Your Crush when You're a Klutz Around Him1,"Think about something that you’ve done recently that makes you proud. Try to conjure up the details of this accomplishment right before you know you’re about to run into your crush. If you run into him unexpectedly, then take a few seconds to think of what you can do and compose yourself.For example, you might think of a time when you weren’t clumsy, such as when you won that marathon the other day.You could also recall how you improved your grades in a certain class. If you work hard enough at anything, you can improve it. , If you’ve just tripped or if you start stuttering, calm your nerves by exhaling and inhaling a number of times before continuing. Try inhaling slowly as you count to five, then exhale slowly as you count to five. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and refocus before proceeding.If your crush questions what you are doing, you might say, “Oh, I’ve just got a lot going on. I was trying to clear my mind so I could pay attention to you.”, There is a great deal of power in positive thinking. So, if you’ve had a bad day and something happened in front of your crush, then you might want to tell yourself, “It’s just one day,” or “I can do this.” Eventually you will start to believe your own words.You might say to yourself, “You have too much going on to worry about this. Let’s move on.” Or, “Let’s make tomorrow a better day.”, If you find yourself closing your body off after an embarrassing moment, force yourself to adopt an open stance. Uncross your arms and legs. Lift your head and look around. Make eye contact with those persons near you.You can also subtly flirt with your crush by touching your face or neck. You may notice that they start to mirror your movements as well.  Start paying close attention to your body and your emotions. If you notice that you start to feel jittery right before you get really clumsy, then use this as a sign that you probably need to go sit down somewhere. Or, if your mind feels as if it racing before you begin to stutter, then try to calm down before speaking.  Take a moment to recall how you’ve survived all sorts of crazy incidents in the past. This will remind you that you are a survivor. In fact, many of the incidents that you remember can’t even be recalled by your crush. When you feel as if you can’t go on, just think about how you’ve had this emotion before and you’ve done just fine.","['Think about something that you’ve done recently that makes you proud.', 'Try to conjure up the details of this accomplishment right before you know you’re about to run into your crush.', 'If you run into him unexpectedly, then take a few seconds to think of what you can do and compose yourself.', 'For example, you might think of a time when you weren’t clumsy, such as when you won that marathon the other day.', 'You could also recall how you improved your grades in a certain class.', 'If you work hard enough at anything, you can improve it.', ', If you’ve just tripped or if you start stuttering, calm your nerves by exhaling and inhaling a number of times before continuing.', 'Try inhaling slowly as you count to five, then exhale slowly as you count to five.', 'This will allow you to collect your thoughts and refocus before proceeding.', 'If your crush questions what you are doing, you might say, “Oh, I’ve just got a lot going on.', 'I was trying to clear my mind so I could pay attention to you.”', ', There is a great deal of power in positive thinking.', 'So, if you’ve had a bad day and something happened in front of your crush, then you might want to tell yourself, “It’s just one day,” or “I can do this.”', 'Eventually you will start to believe your own words.', 'You might say to yourself, “You have too much going on to worry about this.', 'Let’s move on.”', 'Or, “Let’s make tomorrow a better day.”', ', If you find yourself closing your body off after an embarrassing moment, force yourself to adopt an open stance.', 'Uncross your arms and legs.', 'Lift your head and look around.', 'Make eye contact with those persons near you.', 'You can also subtly flirt with your crush by touching your face or neck.', 'You may notice that they start to mirror your movements as well.', 'Start paying close attention to your body and your emotions.', 'If you notice that you start to feel jittery right before you get really clumsy, then use this as a sign that you probably need to go sit down somewhere.', 'Or, if your mind feels as if it racing before you begin to stutter, then try to calm down before speaking.', 'Take a moment to recall how you’ve survived all sorts of crazy incidents in the past.', 'This will remind you that you are a survivor.', 'In fact, many of the incidents that you remember can’t even be recalled by your crush.', 'When you feel as if you can’t go on, just think about how you’ve had this emotion before and you’ve done just fine.']"

Pay attention to your body language.",How to Make a Guy Come Talk to You1,"Believe it or not, boys get just as shy as girls do when it comes to making the first move. Smiles are friendly and welcoming – a smile can make a guy feel instantly secure about walking over and introducing himself. On the other hand, a frown is sure to make him nervous and keep him away.  This goes hand in hand with smiling. You can smile all day long, but unless you make eye contact when you do it, it won’t signal to him that you want him to come talk to you.If you make eye contact and smile as you pass him he will notice, especially if it happens often. If he smiles back, all the better!Eye contact is great, but avoid outright staring at him. Glance over occasionally, but don’t stare too long.  This is far more important than your hair or your clothes. Having confidence is not only an attractive personality trait, but it also makes you a more dynamic, interesting person. Someone with confidence will automatically attract people. Radiate positivity!, When a guy sees you talking to his friends, it makes him feel much more comfortable about approaching you himself.Just make sure you aren’t flirting with his friends!

Also, smile a lot, not so much that it's cheesy, but show him you are confident with yourself.Find out what he likes doing and be there doing the same thing. Do you both like sports, or maybe science? If you can, be in the same place with him doing the same activity. , Say ""Hi!"" and ""Bye!"" and be friendly. Wave at him.

A few stylish items (seasonal, of course) will help you stand out.Get a new haircut. Talk with your stylist or your mom's stylist about maybe changing up your hair. How would it look short? What if you layered it a bit? Consider these things in order to get noticed.Do you need to drop a few pounds? Talk with your mom about whether you can join a gym or sports team. Even if you don't need to lose weight, staying in shape or losing something as small as half a pound will make you feel great, but if he doesn't accept you the way you are, than he isn't right for you. His loss!, There is no such thing as a girlfriend who isn't first and foremost a friend. In fact, the best girlfriend is one who is not always romantic, but one that is a friend.  This does not mean betraying or belittling your own beliefs. Yours are every bit as important as his. Discuss them when you can.Listen to what he has to say. Always hear him out. Take the opportunity to learn new facts about him. Respect what he says but form your own opinions about them.Have conversations with him. Attraction often starts when we have a great emotional connection with someone by really bonding with him. Try to have interesting, funny, playful conversations with him to establish that bond. It doesn't matter what you talk about. The important thing is that you have meaningful interaction.Ask him about his background — his parents, his childhood, his siblings. These things are personal, so be respectful. Offer to share your own background to give him a better idea of who you are.Ask him about his goals — what he always dreamed about being, what he's interested in, what makes him happy. You can learn a lot about a person from his goals. Start thinking about your own goals so that you can share them with him.

Don't let him wonder whether or not you're his friend — make it absolutely clear.Don't gossip about him. Gossip has a way of spreading like wildfire. You don't want juicy stuff getting back to him quite yet. Shut down the gossip.  Small talk is fine in the beginning; you don't want to rush into it, or else it will seem weird.

Girls do usually reach puberty earlier than guys, so girls usually reach that level of emotional maturity earlier as well.  Be casual about it: ""Hey, I realized I didn't have your phone number."" Establishing a friendship outside of school or extracurriculars will be important.Wait for him to call you. You don't want to come on too strong; guys don't like talking on the phone as much as girls.Text him kind of regularly, just for simple conversation. Don't make it pointless, however, because guys don't like small-talk.Flirt with him with texts (Facebook, IM, and emails will also work). Say something like ""I didn't know you'd singlehandedly destroy the football team on Friday. Nice work!"", Guys will often let you know if he's interested in you or not without putting any words to it. There will be a part of you that will be able to tell by instinct.Be on the lookout for signs that he's nervous around you. It could mean he likes you. Does he:Sweat or blush when he talks to you? It could be his body saying that he's into you.Look at you and then look away when you catch him staring? He can't get enough of your looks, and he's day-dreaming.Constantly hang around you, but not with you? It could be we wants to look at and be around you, but doesn't want you to know.  If he's hugging or holding hands with you, then you're golden. He likes you. But here are some other signs in case you're not completely sure.Do his pupils dilate when he looks at you? Sometimes his eyes will change color slightly.Does he touch you, offer to give you piggybacks, or bump into you randomly? He could want to get any excuse to touch you because he likes you.Gulp loudly or stumble around with his words? His heart is pumping hard and he's worried about messing up.Don't trust too many other minute-by-minute changes to his anatomy. Some of those changes, even the more obvious ones, are completely random in very young men for several years.  Remember, it's better to have tried and failed than to never try in the first place. Wait for the right moment. You'll pretty much know when the time comes.If you are ready to ask him out don't say it in front of a group or something or he might say no.Be calm, cool and collected while you're asking him. Make eye contact with him and remember to smile. Be confident. It's really hard to ask him, but you're up for the challenge, aren't you?Ask him if he wants to go to the movies or grab a bite to eat. You don't have to call it a date for it to be a date.  Yes, it will feel bad for a time. No, it won't last forever. Remind yourself of all that you have to offer. There will be plenty of other guys.If he says ""no,"" just smile and walk away with your emotions covered up.Try not to be awkward around him or mean to him. Staying classy might cause him to reconsider.  For instance, kiss him when he says yes to being your boyfriend, but then for the first week or so settle with hugging and holding hands. If he wants to kiss you, go ahead!If he kisses you, don't make it a passionate kiss the first time. You want him to be interested in kissing you again, so only give him a little taste the first time.Don't let him pressure you into anything. Relationships are about mutual respect, not one person getting something the other isn't comfortable with.  At the beginning of a relationship, some people think it's a brilliant idea to make a pact that they'll still be friends when we break-up. Don't do this.This gives the guy a sense of security, so generally he won't be heartbroken to lose you.Plus, it's weird to talk about breakups in the beginning. How do you know what you'll be feeling when you break up? You just don't know. Talk about happier things.Instead of talking about the relationship, just be in the relationship. This will help the guy out. Sometimes, it's better and easier to act instead of talk.  Guys need some space. Just because he's hanging out with his friends doesn't mean he doesn't like you, or that he likes someone else.Let him see his friends. Don't become clingy. Yes, spend a substantial time together in the afternoon or weekends, but let him see his friends at school.If he never makes time for you, however, that's a warning sign. Make sure that he gives you enough time. He should want to be with you if he's in a relationship with you, you might just have to tell him that you need him to pay more attention to you.Don't get upset every time he talks to another girl. Guys are allowed to talk to other girls, just not flirt or go over the line with them. Trust him until he gives you a reason not to.  Don't obsessively talk with him all night on social networks or MSN. If you don't talk to him every second, it will make him want to talk to you even more!Spend most of your time talking in person or on the phone. It's okay to call him every other or every third night. You don't want an awkward internet-relationship where you don't feel comfortable with one another in person.It's okay to send him sweet messages every once in a while. Make them surprises. If you do it irregularly, he'll be even more excited. Don't always expect a response.  Don't let him treat you like a doormat. You're a living, breathing human being, and you deserve respect.Don't let him boss you around or tell you what to do. Stand up for yourself when you need to.Love yourself first. If you can't love yourself, it's hard to love him. You'll find a lot of things you like and dislike about yourself in a relationship. They're like mirrors.Change the things about yourself that you dislike, and guard the things about yourself that you like.Relationships are about two people. If you're doing all the work and he just sits back and enjoys it, you're not doing yourself any favors.Make sure he shows you affection, too. You deserve respect and consideration. Make sure he knows this.  Breakups happen all the time; there's still a chance that you could get back together, or if there's not, there are plenty of other guys out there.There's no need to unfriend him on Facebook or MSN. Just unsubscribe from him and don't talk to him.Be friendly but distant. You want to be nice to him, but you don't want him to get any ideas. You want him to feel stupid that you ever broke up in the first place.Hold your head high. You're growing into a beautiful young lady. Be confident about who you are and people will appreciate you.","[""If he looks at you a lot, it probably means he's interested, but if not yet, then just keep trying using the steps below."", ""They

Take pride in your appearance. Stay smiling. Keep an eye on your posture. Strike up a conversation with his friends. Resist the urge to apologize.,How to Make Friends with Your Crush when You're a Klutz Around Him2,"If you think you might run into your crush, take a few extra minutes to brush your hair an extra bit or maybe put on one of your favorite tops. Don’t go overboard but a little extra primping may give you that extra bit of poise to counteract any klutziness.For example, you could style your hair in a way that makes you feel the most confident, such as a sophisticated up-do. Or, you could give yourself a home manicure or pedicure every other week.Other people will also notice that you look put together and they will be less likely to pick on you or bother you as a result. Your confidence will make them view any mishaps on your part as simply accidents and nothing more.  Keep a slight smile on your face, even if the going gets tough. This will show others that you are not that affected by any klutzy behavior and that you’ve moved on, so they should too. Smiling also relaxes your body, reduces stress, and makes other people feel more comfortable with you.If you are not sure how your smile looks, you might want to practice a bit in front of a mirror. You will soon find that it comes naturally to you when you feel good.  The best way to demonstrate that you do control your body is to carry yourself in the best possible way. Keep your back straight and pay attention to holding your shoulders back as you walk. Focus on taking clear, deep breaths as well. A benefit of maintaining proper posture is that it will also help to minimize any clumsiness in the future.As you walk over to meet your crush and other friends, imagine balancing a book on your head. Each step that you take must be slow and chosen carefully. This will make you less likely to trip or fall.  If you are unsure whether or not you can talk to your crush without stumbling, try to interact with his friends instead. Ask them about their hobbies or interests. Talk to them about the day’s events. Just be casual and discuss anything that comes to mind. This can help you build up to interacting with your crush directly.You might say, “Did you all go to the football game on Friday?” Or, “What do you guys have planned for Spring Break?”, As soon as you fall, you may feel the need to stand up and say, “I’m sorry,” to everyone who witnessed it. Unless you hurt or knocked someone else down, this isn’t really necessary. Stating an apology could make you feel better, but it will likely make you feel worse and even less worthy of being around your crush. So, just skip it entirely.","['If you think you might run into your crush, take a few extra minutes to brush your hair an extra bit or maybe put on one of your favorite tops.', 'Don’t go overboard but a little extra primping may give you that extra bit of poise to counteract any klutziness.', 'For example, you could style your hair in a way that makes you feel the most confident, such as a sophisticated up-do.', 'Or, you could give yourself a home manicure or pedicure every other week.', 'Other people will also notice that you look put together and they will be less likely to pick on you or bother you as a result.', 'Your confidence will make them view any mishaps on your part as simply accidents and nothing more.', 'Keep a slight smile on your face, even if the going gets tough.', 'This will show others that you are not that affected by any klutzy behavior and that you’ve moved on, so they should too.', 'Smiling also relaxes your body, reduces stress, and makes other people feel more comfortable with you.', 'If you are not sure how your smile looks, you might want to practice a bit in front of a mirror.', 'You will soon find that it comes naturally to you when you feel good.', 'The best way to demonstrate that you do control your body is to carry yourself in the best possible way.', 'Keep your back straight and pay attention to holding your shoulders back as you walk.', 'Focus on taking clear, deep breaths as well.', 'A benefit of maintaining proper posture is that it will also help to minimize any clumsiness in the future.', 'As you walk over to meet your crush and other friends, imagine balancing a book on your head.', 'Each step that you take must be slow and chosen carefully.', 'This will make you less likely to trip or fall.', 'If you are unsure whether or not you can talk to your crush without stumbling, try to interact with his friends instead.', 'Ask them about their hobbies or interests.', 'Talk to them about the day’s events.', 'Just be casual and discuss anything that comes to mind.', 'This can help you build up to interacting with your crush directly.', 'You might say, “Did you all go to the football game on Friday?”', 'Or, “What do you guys have planned for Spring Break?”, As soon as you fall, you may feel the need to stand up and say, “I’m sorry,” to everyone who witnessed it.', 'Unless you hurt or knocked someone else down, this isn’t really necessary.', 'Stating an apology could make you feel better, but it will likely make you feel worse and even less worthy of being around your crush.', 'So, just skip it entirely.']"
"Laugh off any accidents. Swap embarrassing stories with others. Talk about what you love. Recognize if he is nervous, too. Don’t be put off by his silence. Focus on minor details around you. Feel out his interest level with casual questions. Ask your friends for help.",How to Make Friends with Your Crush when You're a Klutz Around Him3,"Right after you do something clumsy, come up laughing. This takes a potentially negative moment and makes it into a positive one. It also makes it less likely that anyone will try to pick on you because of the incident. They are more likely to laugh right along.  This is a good way to build community with others on the basis of what might have seemed like a negative event. They will likely agree with you and may even tell you a few stories of their own.You could say, “I hate when I trip over my own feet. Have you ever done that before?”, If gracefulness isn’t your strong suit, switch the subject to something that you are good at. When you start to talk about something that you are passionate about, others will instantly be interested and will forget any prior actions on your part. The dopamine that comes from relieving a hobby of yours will also help to calm your nerves down.For example, you might say, “I just went to this amazing concert last week. Let me tell you guys all about it.”, Just after you’ve had a clumsy moment, take a second to look closely at your crush. You may seem that he is sweating a bit or perhaps wringing his hands too. These are signs that he is nervous as well. It means that you are not alone.You can also watch for erratic eye contact. If he can’t look you directly in the face, he may be nervous. He may blush as well.  Your crush might be shy. Or, he might feel bad for you after an embarrassing moment and not know what to say. Give him the benefit of the doubt and don’t expect too much conversation until you get to know him better. Be patient and keep trying to reach out to him in friendship.You might start by simply saying, “Hi!” on a regular basis. If he responds, great. If not, then keeping moving on.  If you are talking with your crush and his friends and find yourself growing more nervous, turn your attention to your surroundings. Look at the people around you and pay attention to what they are wearing. Try to pick out your favorite elements of the room that you are in. Try to stay engaged but a bit distracted at the same time.  If you want to gauge your crush’s level of interest in you, without resorting to klutzy questioning, then try to talk with him about relationships and friendships in general. Ask him about his closest friends. Talk to him about his family relationships.Pay attention to not only what he says, but how he answers the questions as well. Does he give you his full attention or are you an afterthought?You might say, “Tell me about your best friend. You said that he lives out of town, right?”, Tell your friends about your dilemma and ask them to walk around with you when you might run into your crush. They will hopefully distract everyone from anything embarrassing that you might do. They can also talk about your positive traits and give you a dose of needed confidence. Make sure to return the favor when you can.You might tell your friends, “I could really use your help when I’m around my crush. If you could start talking to everyone or distract them if I do something klutzy, that would be great.”","['Right after you do something clumsy, come up laughing.', 'This takes a potentially negative moment and makes it into a positive one.', 'It also makes it less likely that anyone will try to pick on you because of the incident.', 'They are more likely to laugh right along.', 'This is a good way to build community with others on the basis of what might have seemed like a negative event.', 'They will likely agree with you and may even tell you a few stories of their own.', 'You could say, “I hate when I trip over my own feet.', 'Have you ever done that before?”, If gracefulness isn’t your strong suit, switch the subject to something that you are good at.', 'When you start to talk about something that you are passionate about, others will instantly be interested and will forget any prior actions on your part.', 'The dopamine that comes from relieving a hobby of yours will also help to calm your nerves down.', 'For example, you might say, “I just went to this amazing concert last week.', 'Let me tell you guys all about it.”, Just after you’ve had a clumsy moment, take a second to look closely at your crush.', 'You may seem that he is sweating a bit or perhaps wringing his hands too.', 'These are signs that he is nervous as well.', 'It means that you are not alone.', 'You can also watch for erratic eye contact.', 'If he can’t look you directly in the face, he may be nervous.', 'He may blush as well.', 'Your crush might be shy.', 'Or, he might feel bad for you after an embarrassing moment and not know what to say.', 'Give him the benefit of the doubt and don’t expect too much conversation until you get to know him better.', 'Be patient and keep trying to reach out to him in friendship.', 'You might start by simply saying, “Hi!”', 'on a regular basis.', 'If he responds, great.', 'If not, then keeping moving on.', 'If you are talking with your crush and his friends and find yourself growing more nervous, turn your attention to your surroundings.', 'Look at the people around you and pay attention to what they are wearing.', 'Try to pick out your favorite elements of the room that you are in.', 'Try to stay engaged but a bit distracted at the same time.', 'If you want to gauge your crush’s level of interest in you, without resorting to klutzy questioning, then try to talk with him about relationships and friendships in general.', 'Ask him about his closest friends.', 'Talk to him about his family relationships.', 'Pay attention to not only what he says, but how he answers the questions as well.', 'Does he give you his full attention or are you an afterthought?You might say, “Tell me about your best friend.', 'You said that he lives out of town, right?”, Tell your friends about your dilemma and ask them to walk around with you when you might run into your crush.', 'They will hopefully distract everyone from anything embarrassing that you might do.', 'They can also talk about your positive traits and give you a dose of needed confidence.', 'Make sure to return the favor when you can.', 'You might tell your friends, “I could really use your help when I’m around my crush.', 'If you could start talking to everyone or distract them if I do something klutzy, that would be great.”']"
Put yourself in his line of sight. Sit near him. Create a situation that prompts him to approach you. Share a common interest. Join his friend group.,How to Make a Guy Come Talk to You2,"If you see a natural opportunity to walk past him, take it! If you notice that he walks down a certain hallway every day at a certain time, position yourself there. Do this sparingly, otherwise you may come off as desperate.Make sure when you are walking past him that you are doing so for a purpose. Get a drink from a water fountain he’s standing near or go into the library if he’s standing out front chatting with his friends.When you do walk past him, makes sure to stand up straight, hold your head up high, walk with confidence and have a smile on your face.  This doesn’t mean sit right NEXT to him – that would be too obvious! But sitting near him (in his line of vision, if possible) can definitely get you noticed and create a scenario in which he’ll approach you to talk. If you share a class with him, sit nearby.

"Don't be too serious, unless the event actually is serious. Show off your natural beauty - this is incredibly important. Wear the right clothes If you want to impress a guy, don't wear extremely baggy clothes, as they sometimes make certain girls look fatter than they actually are!,Participate in a sport to make a good topic for conversation. Get into health and fitness. Smile!,Make your hair look presentable. Have something which makes you different from your friends.",How to Make a Guy Like You Without Doing a Lot,"Guys like you more if you are just laid back and cool about things. If someone spills something on your Tori Burch handbag, don't cry and whine, even though you may want to. If you fall in the hallway or slip, just laugh at yourself in public. You can hit yourself in the head as much as you want to when you're alone. , Most guys don't like the girls that have the huge black fake eyelashes, the thick eyeliner, or the blood red lipstick. Embrace your natural beauty! Try going without make up, or just wearing minimal makeup. For everyday makeup, try wearing neutral colors like brown rather than black around your eyes.Makeup should add glow, not color.  Try to find clothes that fit you, and enhance the good features of your figure. Yes, this does mean that going to the store and trying on the clothes is better than ordering them online where you're not sure if they will fit or not, but it's good to know what you're buying is perfect for you. Also, don't feel like you should wear your lowest top or shortest skirt to impress him. It'll do the opposite and make you look cheap, shallow, and desperate.  Guys love girls who have hobbies. It's okay not to play a lot of sports, but some guys tend to like girls who can throw a ball or shoot a basket. When sport season starts, try encouraging your friends to join a sport team with you and maybe try to learn a few things about the sports your crush likes.  Having a good body will make you more confident, and guys find confidence in a girl very attractive. Try small things like replacing your daily chocolate bar with an item of fruit, cutting down on the amount of TV you watch, and walking rather than using transport (which is environmentally friendly too). If you want a drastic change with your figure then start a fitness regime and ask friends or family to do it with you for support.  Everyone (yes, boys and girls) love someone who can smile and laugh. Try to be optimistic and look at the glass as half full as opposed to half empty.  As long as you take care of your hair and don't walk around looking like you've been dragged through a hedge backwards then don't worry. Also, don't worry about hair colour, some guys like blonds, some like brunettes, some like red heads, everyone has different taste.  It could be anything, even a small thing. Maybe a hobby, such as dance or art or a certain sport. Or it could be a phrase or saying that you have, nothing annoying though, and don't say it too often. Or perhaps something about the clothes you wear, try dressing slightly different to the people around you, as friends are often highly influenced by each others taste in fashion. Don't buy loads of shocking clothes, but just don't copy too much.","['Guys like you more if you are just laid back and cool about things.', ""If someone spills something on your Tori Burch handbag, don't cry and whine, even though you may want to."", 'If you fall in the hallway or slip, just laugh at yourself in public.', ""You can hit yourself in the head as much as you want to when you're alone."", "", Most guys don't like the girls that have the huge black fake eyelashes, the thick eyeliner, or the blood red lipstick."", 'Embrace your natural beauty!', 'Try going without make up, or just wearing minimal makeup.', 'For everyday makeup, try wearing neutral colors like brown rather than black around your eyes.', 'Makeup should add glow, not color.', 'Try to find clothes that fit you, and enhance the good features of your figure.', ""Yes, this does mean that going to the store and trying on the clothes is better than ordering them online where you're not sure if they will fit or not, but it's good to know what you're buying is perfect for you."", ""Also, don't feel like you should wear your lowest top or shortest skirt to impress him."", ""It'll do the opposite and make you look cheap, shallow, and desperate."", 'Guys love girls who have hobbies.', ""It's okay not to play a lot of sports, but some guys tend to like girls who can throw a ball or shoot a basket."", 'When sport season starts, try encouraging your friends to join a sport team with you and maybe try to learn a few things about the sports your crush likes.', 'Having a good body will make you more confident, and guys find confidence in a girl very attractive.', 'Try small things like replacing your daily chocolate bar with an item of fruit, cutting down on the amount of TV you watch, and walking rather than using transport (which is environmentally friendly too).', 'If you want a drastic change with your figure then start a fitness regime and ask friends or family to do it with you for support.', 'Everyone (yes, boys and girls) love someone who can smile and laugh.', 'Try to be optimistic and look at the glass as half full as opposed to half empty.', ""As long as you take care of your hair and don't walk around looking like you've been dragged through a hedge backwards then don't worry."", ""Also, don't worry about hair colour, some guys like blonds, some like brunettes, some like red heads, everyone has different taste."", 'It could be anything, even a small thing.', 'Maybe a hobby, such as dance or art or a certain sport.', ""Or it could be a phrase or saying that you have, nothing annoying though, and don't say it too often."", 'Or perhaps something about the clothes you wear, try dressing slightly different to the people around you, as friends are often highly influenced by each others taste in fashion.', ""Don't buy loads of shocking clothes, but just don't copy too much.""]"
"Go to any church services early. Attend Bible classes and church youth groups as much as possible. Get involved in church activities. Ensure you look approachable, but not too approachable. Make sure you don't look so approachable. Be mature. Grab every possible opportunity to talk to the Christian boy. Compliment him whenever he has done anything positive. Dress modestly to make a Christian boy like you. Don't forget the reason why you go to church. Study the Bible.",How to Make a Christian Guy Like You (for Teens),"You have to show your Christian guy that you are mature enough when it comes to spiritual matters by showing how keen you are to worship. As a Christian, you may consider this deception as you haven't arrived early to praise the Lord, you are there early to try to get a boy to like you. , This will be more successful if the Christian boy you like goes to the Bible classes or youth groups. If he does not, you might meet someone new.  Show the Christian Boy you are having fun at these events! Smile, laugh, be generous and warm. A Christian guy should love a Christian girl that serves the Lord with joy and amusement.  You need to look nice, appear to be a good listener and a fun person to be with. This will attract people with similar qualities to you.  The Christian boy will think everyone can talk to you during the Hour of Worship. If your church doesn't have an Hour of Worship, try paying attention to the service and praying in respectful silence. Christian Boys usually like girls who behave appropriately in Church at all times.  Don't act in any way that could be interpreted as immature. It is suggested that you should behave yourself when inside the church in a way appropriate for your age.  Whenever you have the chance to talk to him, take the opportunity. If you are shy, and he's shy also, nothing will happen so if you want to make a boy like you, be brave and talk to him.  For example, you could say ""Hey you know what, you really did a great job handing out the hymn books.""Or, if the Christian boy has done a good job explaining something in some church related activity you could say, ""I really did understand the -------- *topic* and it has now become easier for me to explain it to others!""Go on to say, ""Hmm, I am thinking if maybe you could give me some Bible studies over ------ *Place*"". Your Christian boy may start to like you if you ask him to help you with your bible studies, especially if he can also help you with your English.Try saying, ""Hi"", by doing this, you will look lovely! This may not make him like you. This may just make him think you are friendly.  Look mature, look religious and respectable. You don't have to dress like you're going at a party or on a red carpet or go too far the other way a dress as a nun.Appropriate church clothes may make a boy like you. Look presentable and you'll feel comfortable. If you want to put some makeup, keep it natural. Face powder, blush on and lip gloss will do. Remember some Christian Boys like teen girls who don't wear any makeup.  You're inside the church so respect God. Behave yourself and don't go like ""Ah! I saw him! OMG"". These are suitable things to say in Church.Remember that you're inside a sacred place. However, since you have already been gazing around looking for a boy to try to make like you, this may not be of great concern to you. Theoretically, you shouldn't be trying to make a boy from church like you in Church.  This can be a great help for starting conversations with him. Talk about God and His disciples and the prophets to make him like you.","['You have to show your Christian guy that you are mature enough when it comes to spiritual matters by showing how keen you are to worship.', ""As a Christian, you may consider this deception as you haven't arrived early to praise the Lord, you are there early to try to get a boy to like you."", ', This will be more successful if the Christian boy you like goes to the Bible classes or youth groups.', 'If he does not, you might meet someone new.', 'Show the Christian', 'Boy you are having fun at these events!', 'Smile, laugh, be generous and warm.', 'A Christian guy should love a Christian girl that serves the Lord with joy and amusement.', 'You need to look nice, appear to be a good listener and a fun person to be with.', 'This will attract people with similar qualities to you.', 'The Christian boy will think everyone can talk to you during the Hour of Worship.', ""If your church doesn't have an Hour of Worship, try paying attention to the service and praying in respectful silence."", 'Christian Boys usually like girls who behave appropriately in Church at all times.', ""Don't act in any way that could be interpreted as immature."", 'It is suggested that you should behave yourself when inside the church in a way appropriate for your age.', 'Whenever you have the chance to talk to him, take the opportunity.', ""If you are shy, and he's shy also, nothing will happen so if you want to make a boy like you, be brave and talk to him."", 'For example, you could say ""Hey you know what, you really did a great job handing out the hymn books.', '""Or, if the Christian boy has done a good job explaining something in some church related activity you could say, ""I really did understand the -------- *topic* and it has now become easier for me to explain it to others!""Go on to say, ""Hmm, I am thinking if maybe you could give me some Bible studies over ------', '*Place*"".', 'Your Christian boy may start to like you if you ask him to help you with your bible studies, especially if he can also help you with your English.', 'Try saying, ""Hi"", by doing this, you will look lovely!', 'This may not make him like you.', 'This may just make him think you are friendly.', 'Look mature, look religious and respectable.', ""You don't have to dress like you're going at a party or on a red carpet or go too far the other way a dress as a nun."", 'Appropriate church clothes may make a boy like you.', ""Look presentable and you'll feel comfortable."", 'If you want to put some makeup, keep it natural.', 'Face powder, blush on and lip gloss will do.', ""Remember some Christian Boys like teen girls who don't wear any makeup."", ""You're inside the church so respect God."", 'Behave yourself and don\'t go like ""Ah!', 'I saw him!', 'OMG"".', 'These are suitable things to say in Church.', ""Remember that you're inside a sacred place."", 'However, since you have already been gazing around looking for a boy to try to make like you, this may not be of great concern to you.', ""Theoretically, you shouldn't be trying to make a boy from church like you in Church."", 'This can be a great help for starting conversations with him.', 'Talk about God and His disciples and the prophets to make him like you.']"

"Find out whether or not he is just joking with you, or if he just likes to mess with people. Pay attention when he is near to see if he sort of invades your personal space. Determine whether he tries to make you laugh. Observe carefully for signs that he is building himself up by showing off. Check for him trying to get your attention by acting silly or brash. Watch the way the guy moves when he sits or stands with you. Ask him if he likes you. Have a trusted friend get the information for you. Determine whether he stares at you often. Watch his eyes. Check out his cheeks. Notice when he touches you. Be alert to attempts to try to help you. Notice panic when you cry. Be alert to his interest in things you like. Watch for deliberate attempts to get near to you. Watch for appearances of jealousy of your current boyfriend or other guy friends?,Use his friends as a gauge.",How to Know if a Guy Likes You in School,"If he jokes around with you then he, may like you, however, he just might like to mess with other people too. When you are sitting at lunch, pay attention to see if he is messing with you just to be funny, or if he is trying to be funny and friendly. If he:Is extremely nice to you, never puts you down.Walks with you in the halls on your way to classes.Acts shy. ,,, For example, he might list all the sports he plays, how much he can do of something, or continually say how good he is at something. Again, this may be a part of the way he is around everyone. Try to figure out if he is taking extraordinary measures to build himself up in your eyes.  He might kick your chair, talk loudly, or act clumsy. These are all signs that something is up and he has an interest in you.  If he is making an effort to sit or stand up straight, then he may like you. If he may be pulling his shirt down, playing with his hat, you can assume it means he is shy and thinks you're pretty. If he stands up for you all the time and is overprotective, then he may like you.  This is the simplest and most direct way to find out. This takes a confident person unless you already are perfectly confident. You'll also have to be able to handle it if he doesn't like you (especially if you like him).  By asking him/her just to ask them or 'observe' them 'further'.  This is something that is very important to look for. If he does stare at you, try to see what kind of a stare it is. Is it a stare like he is lost in his thoughts, or is it a stare meaning he thinks you're weird? Sometimes his eyes can say everything!, Do his pupils dilate when he looks at you? Sometimes, if a boy likes you, his pupils will dilate. Not many people pay attention to this, but sometimes it can be a sign that he is crushing on you.  Do his cheeks turn any shade of pink or red around you? When you two are having a simple chat in the hall, try to see what color his cheeks are. Do they turn an unusual pink or red around you, or do they stay their normal color? If they are not their normal color, it could be a sign that he is nervous around you and is afraid of embarrassing himself.Slightly look at him if he walks past you or are in lessons and see if he is looking at you. Notice his reaction when he realizes he's been caught. If he blushes or turns away quickly, it's a definite sign he is into you, but don't be upset if he doesn't react because some guys like to act cool and make it seem they weren't looking at you at all.  Does he ever try to gently 'shove' or touch you? If he does this, he could just be friendly, or he could be trying to make an excuse to get closer to you.Does he ever hug you for no reason? Making physical contact is a sign that he likes you.  This usually means he is just being friendly, but if he does it often, it may mean that he wants to make an excuse for you two to get closer.  If he panics more than your other guy friends would when you cry, it's a sign. Ever had those kind of days where nothing seems to be going right and you break into tears? Pay attention to his reaction: Does he ask what's wrong and who/what caused it and tries hard to make you laugh or at least smile? If he does any of this more often than your other guy friends, it means he cares about you and likes you.  Have you ever talked to him about a TV show or a video game and a week later he is hooked on it? It means he is either really into the same things as you, or he wants you to like him more.  Does he ever try to sit by you in class? If your class does not have certain seating arrangements, does he try his best every day to sit near you?Has he asked for your phone number yet and does he text you a lot? If he hasn't got your number, no problem, it might mean he is shy or nervous.  Have you ever caught him glaring/narrowing his eyes at a boy you talk to? He might be jealous of other guys around you.Look at his expression when you are talking to other guys. Does he look angry or act moody or even comes and interrupts you when you are talking?, Do his friends laugh at him and look at you like they know something you should know? This can be a dead giveaway. It is usually the friends that let the boy's crush find out he likes them. Try to look for that when you walk near.Do they a giggle and nudge your crush and make lovey dovey noises or smirk at him?Does he hang around your friends a lot?

Practice good hygiene. Choose outfits that are mature and put together. Develop a personal sense of style. Develop a knowledge of current events and pop culture. Discuss your skills and abilities in school or your career. Focus on topics or interests you have in common. Focus on being yourself around the older guy. Practice active listening. Share your feelings and emotions. Demonstrate independence and self sufficiency.,How to Impress an Older Guy,"Show him you are well-groomed and put together by ensuring you maintain good hygiene. Shower every day, make sure you brush and floss at least twice a day, and present a clean appearance.  You can let an older guy know that you can be mature and put together by choosing outfits and clothing that appear more adult. Go for outfits that project maturity rather than a childish or teenager look.  A big part of acting mature is being able to own your own sense of style, based on your tastes and preferences. Don’t expect to wake up one day and have personal sense of style. Instead, let your sense of style evolve as you evolve. As you grow older, your taste in clothing will change over time. It may help to focus on a certain style of dressing, like surfer girl style or ladylike style, and then tailor it to fit your personality and your tastes.One way you can develop your own sense of style is to find an older style icon and emulate their style. This could be a classic film star like Carey Grant or Grace Kelly, or it could be your mother or father’s style in the 70s or 80s. Look at how your style icon dresses and carries themselves. Try to find clothing that has a similar cut or look and style yourself after an older style icon.If you’re trying to create an outfit for a night out, you should think about dressing mature and still true to yourself. This could mean higher necklines and lower hemlines, but also an element that is true to your personality or sense of style, like a cool necklace or a vintage coat. The idea is to project confidence and maturity with how you wear your clothing, rather than what you are wearing.  Show the older guy that you have a strong intellect by reading up on current events and pop culture. You can then bring up current events in conversation when you are around the older guy or on a date with him. You should try to have a well-informed opinion about local and global issues and be willing to engage in conversation that is interesting and engaging.You can become well-versed in current events and pop culture by reading articles online and in print in magazines, newspapers, and journals. You can also watch videos online about pop culture and world issues so you are armed with lots of intelligent information you can discuss with the older guy.  Take pride in your skills and abilities at school or at work and don’t be afraid to discuss them with the older guy. If you are a star student in a particular subject or an ace employee at the office, brag and let the older guy know that you are in control and in charge in a certain area of your life. This will show him you have skills and abilities that you excel in. Your confidence and skills will surely impress him and make him more interested in you as a person.One way you can show off your skills or abilities is to invite him to an event or setting that will allow you to demonstrate them. This could be an art show displaying your artwork, a sporting event where he can watch you play, or an office event where you can show off how well-regarded you are among your co-workers.You can also share this information in conversation by asking the older guy what he is most proud of or asking him about his skills and abilities. He may then reciprocate by asking you about your skills and abilities, thereby allowing you to share them without appearing cocky or egotistical. For example, you could suggest: ""Let's talk about things we are proud of"" or ask him, ""What do you feel you are good at?"", If you know you and the older guy share certain topics or interests in common, you should focus your conversation around these interests. This could be a shared interest in science fiction novels or a sports team, or perhaps a shared experience of backpacking through Asia alone. Think about topics that you can bring up that will encourage interesting conversation and a feeling of connection between you and the older guy.You can also plan dates or get togethers that focus on a topic or activity of interest, like going to see a favorite author read at a bookstore or going to watch a hockey game of a team you both love. This will show the older guy that you are trying to create experiences that you will both enjoy and that you are mature enough to consider his needs as well as yours.  Try not to put on an act or pretend to be someone you are not around the older guy. Though you may try to impress the older guy by being someone you are not, it can be difficult to maintain the act and over time, you may slip up or not be able to keep pretending. Avoid giving the guy a false sense of yourself and start the relationship on an honest, straightforward note. Be forthcoming and yourself around the guy so you appear confident and self-aware to him. This will likely impress him more than a false representation of yourself.  Impress the older guy with your ability to be a good listener and practice active listening. Active listening is the process of viewing every conversation as a learning opportunity, where you can get to know someone better or learn something new from someone else. When you actively listen to someone speak, they can tell you are interested in what they are saying and are skilled at sincere and engaging conversation.Do active listening with the older guy by asking him about his day and then listening to him fully as he speaks. Listen without interrupting but show you are engaged by nodding and maintaining eye contact with him. Once he is finished speaking, repeat back what he said in your own words, such as, “I think you mean…” or “What I hear you saying is…”You can also offer advice or comment on what he tells you. Be thoughtful and take your time when you respond to him, as this will show him you take his words seriously and can be a good active listener.  Avoid bottling up your feelings and emotions or being passive aggressive about your emotions. These are both signs of immaturity and an inability to be emotionally open. Older guys can have more developed emotional maturity due to their age and experience, so meet him halfway by being willing to share your feelings if you are upset or bothered by something or someone. This means also being honest with him if he does something that annoys you or makes you uncomfortable, as this will show him you can be confident and straightforward.Keeping your feelings and emotions to yourself may seem like an easy to avoid conflict and appear relaxed and easygoing, especially if you are trying to appear cool and collected to an older guy. But being dishonest about your feelings will only lead to conflict later on and less trust between you and the older guy. If the older guy is as mature as he seems, he will react to your honesty with compassion and gratitude.For example, if the older guy does something that upsets you, rather than get upset and start a screaming match or give him the silent treatment, you can respond by suggesting that you both discuss the issue and try to resolve it together. If he forgets your birthday, for example, you may tell him: ""I'm sure you didn't mean to be hurtful, but when you forgot my birthday I felt really hurt. It felt like you didn't value a day that's important to me. Can we talk about it?"", Another big turn on for older guys is a partner who is not overly needy or insecure. Show him that you can be independent and self sufficient so that he comes to see you as his equal, rather than a younger, inexperienced partner.This means not calling or texting him all day, every day, or insisting that you spend every minute together.You should cultivate your own friend group and stay connected to your family and friends, even if you become involved with the older guy. This will illustrate your independence and likely lead to a healthier relationship.Do things on your own occasionally, like going to a concert or seeing a movie. Knowing that you can have fun by yourself will make you more confident, which is impressive to older guys.","['Show him you are well-groomed and put together by ensuring you maintain good hygiene.',

Apply it on or below your waterline in thick but moderate strokes. Keeping it thick is important, as the waterline may cause it to be washed off.Carefully apply eyeliner over your top eyelashes. Keep your stroke light as a thick line will cause you to appear to have a black eye.Add color to your eyes. For a unique appearance that complements your outfits, use eyeshadow to add a dramatic flair to your eyes. Although optional, it is recommended if you want to place the focus on your eyes.First, choose the color of your eyeshadow.

Apply a light shade before blending it with a dark layer on top. A good example of an ideal combination is black, white, and grey. Brown, pink, and white is another. Purple, white, and silver is also ideal.  Although they may not be as noticeable, your hands should appear just as beautiful as the rest of your body. Paint your fingernails and toenails, as weekly trips to the nail salon can be expensive. Keep your nails trimmed short unless you plan on doing french tips.Clean your nails on a daily basis.

Write down a list your strengths and weaknesses. Smile and make eye contact. Wear clothes that make you feel comfortable. Pursue your own interests. Try not to compare yourself to others.,How to Impress a Boy in Middle School1,"It’s difficult to put yourself out there without healthy self-esteem and a sense of confidence, and shyness is common in middle school. A big part of self-confidence is being more aware of yourself. Writing down a list of your strengths and weaknesses can help you uncover your best attributes. Play these up when interacting with a boy you like.For example, if you have a great smile, be sure to use it often around the boy. Identifying your weaknesses can help you make improvements. ;, Along with confidence, one of the best ways to make yourself more noticeable to a boy is to look approachable. Smiling gives the instant impression that you are friendly and approachable. Making eye contact is also important, but be careful not to stare. , A big part of confidence is looking and feeling your best. It doesn’t mean being overly fancy, just wear clothes that make you happy and it will be easy to project a confident image to the boy you like. For example, if you feel comfortable and attractive in certain outfits, wear them when you know you will see him.  It can be easy to get wrapped up in having a crush on a boy in middle school, but spending some time on your own interests, such as sports, clubs, or other hobbies, can make you look more confident with yourself. Pursuing your interests may even give you something to talk about with the boy you’re trying to impress.  Nothing kills confidence faster than comparing yourself to your peers. It’s easy to feel inadequate when thinking about what you don’t have, so it’s important to minimize these feelings if you want to get the attention of a boy you like.Be cautious when it comes to social media. Many teens spend a lot of time projecting a particular image through their social media profiles, but this is often an exaggeration. Try not to dwell on what your peers are posting on social media because it can harm your self-esteem.","['It’s difficult to put yourself out there without healthy self-esteem and a sense of confidence, and shyness is common in middle school.', 'A big part of self-confidence is being more aware of yourself.', 'Writing down a list of your strengths and weaknesses can help you uncover your best attributes.', 'Play these up when interacting with a boy you like.', 'For example, if you have a great smile, be sure to use it often around the boy.', 'Identifying your weaknesses can help you make improvements.', ';, Along with confidence, one of the best ways to make yourself more noticeable to a boy is to look approachable.', 'Smiling gives the instant impression that you are friendly and approachable.', 'Making eye contact is also important, but be careful not to stare.', ', A big part of confidence is looking and feeling your best.', 'It doesn’t mean being overly fancy, just wear clothes that make you happy and it will be easy to project a confident image to the boy you like.', 'For example, if you feel comfortable and attractive in certain outfits, wear them when you know you will see him.', 'It can be easy to get wrapped up in having a crush on a boy in middle school, but spending some time on your own interests, such as sports, clubs, or other hobbies, can make you look more confident with yourself.', 'Pursuing your interests may even give you something to talk about with the boy you’re trying to impress.', 'Nothing kills confidence faster than comparing yourself to your peers.', 'It’s easy to feel inadequate when thinking about what you don’t have, so it’s important to minimize these feelings if you want to get the attention of a boy you like.', 'Be cautious when it comes to social media.', 'Many teens spend a lot of time projecting a particular image through their social media profiles, but this is often an exaggeration.', 'Try not to dwell on what your peers are posting on social media because it can harm your self-esteem.']"
"Have a location in mind before you start. Wear something sexy. Go easy on the drinks. Get him alone (or close to it). Make sure this is right for you. Get in close. Sit in his lap. Conquer your make out session. Let your hands do the talking. Tell him what you want. Say NO. Don't drive drunk. Make sure someone knows where you are. Keep an eye on your drinks. Bring protection and insist on using it. Bring your phone!,Wake up first. Be cool. Clean yourself up. Leave before it gets awkward. Don't apologize. Kiss him goodbye.",How to Hook Up with a Guy,"It's probably safest to go to a hotel (although your place is the next safest alternative). Make sure your place is clean or that you have a hotel (or other option) ready to go. , Wear something revealing and a little tight but avoid the ""hooker look"" (forgo fishnets, leather, leopard print, etc).  Drinking is okay, you shouldn't feel guilty about wanting to drink, but if you do drink do so safely. If he's super hot, you at least want to remember it in the morning, right?It's safest not to drink alcohol at all. If you don't want to get harassed about it, just tell him that you're allergic (sulfites are a common allergen and are in many types of alcohol).  You need some quiet time to talk. If you're at a party, get him off to the side where you can actually hear each other. Besides, getting all hands-on in front of other people just makes things awkward.  Studies have shown that there's a high correlation between hook-ups and depression, anxiety, and low-self esteem. This is not to say that they cause those feelings, but make sure that you aren't looking for sex just to fill a hole. There are better ways to make your life happier and more fulfilling.  When you're talking to him, stand or sit close. Really close. He should be able to see down your shirt, smell your perfume, and look deep into your lustful eyes.  Get playful and move to sitting in his lap. You'll be sending his hips a direct message about exactly where you want them to be.  Once you've moved on to kissing, own that kiss. Show him who's boss. Nibble a little. Be passionate. Give him a little taste of what he can expect.  Use touch to show him what you have in mind. A casual caress or even a firm grope can show him you mean business.  If he's not taking the hint, tell him exactly what you have in mind. Guys will find that taking that kind of initiative is really sexy. Just say something like, ""I'm feeling pretty tense. I think I could use a workout. Do you want to get out of here and help me get a little exercise?"", If you change your mind, you can say no. If at ANY TIME you feel uncomfortable, you can say no. There is nothing wrong with that. Do what's right for you and don't let someone guilt you into something you don't want to do.  Don't drive if you're drunk and don't let him drive if he's drunk. You don't want this hook up to be to an IV in an ambulance.  You never know what could happen. For your own safety, make sure your bestie or someone else you trust knows where you are.  Never leave your drink unattended and make sure you watch it being opened or poured. Even if your guy is super awesome, that doesn't mean the other guys at the bar are.  Everybody wants their junk to stay healthy, right? Even if you're a girl, have a condom for him to use. And don't let him talk you into going without, even if you are on birth control. Make sure you know how to put it on him (in case he doesn't know how or does it wrong).  Again, you never know, so just make sure you have a phone ready to go with numbers for things like taxi services. Or a friend if you want someone to talk to later.  You want to be the one to wake up first so that you can get out without making things too awkward.  Don't make a big deal out of hooking up. You don't have anything to be ashamed of. Just be calm and let yourself enjoy it.  Put yourself together and make sure all panties are accounted for. Wash off your makeup quickly if it's all smudged and tie up or comb your hair into something that looks intentional. You should also clean up any mess you guys made the night before as best you can without making too much noise.  Leave if you're at a hotel or make an excuse about needing to get him out of your place. You want to clear out before things get too awkward, especially if either of you is new to the hook up.  You don't need to apologize to anyone about hooking up with a guy (unless you have a boyfriend, in which case, oops). Don't apologize to him. You're just going to make both of you feel bad about something you don't need to feel bad about.  A quick kiss goodbye will help make sure everyone leaves with good memories. Leave him your phone number if you want to leave the option open for a Round 2.","[""It's probably safest to go to a hotel (although your place is the next safest alternative)."", 'Make sure your place is clean or that you have a hotel (or other option) ready to go.', ', Wear something revealing and a little tight but avoid the ""hooker look"" (forgo fishnets, leather, leopard print, etc).', ""Drinking is okay, you shouldn't feel guilty about wanting to drink, but if you do drink do so safely."", ""If he's super hot, you at least want to remember it in the morning, right?It's safest not to drink alcohol at all."", ""If you don't want to get harassed about it, just tell him that you're allergic (sulfites are a common allergen and are in many types of alcohol)."", 'You need some quiet time to talk.', ""If you're at a party, get him off to the side where you can actually hear each other."", 'Besides, getting all hands-on in front of other people just makes things awkward.', ""Studies have shown that there's a high correlation between hook-ups and depression, anxiety, and low-self esteem."", ""This is not to say that they cause those feelings, but make sure that you aren't looking for sex just to fill a hole."", 'There are better ways to make your life happier and more fulfilling.', ""When you're talking to him, stand or sit close."", 'Really close.', 'He should be able to see down your shirt, smell your perfume, and look deep into your lustful eyes.', 'Get playful and move to sitting in his lap.', ""You'll be sending his hips a direct message about exactly where you want them to be."", ""Once you've moved on to kissing, own that kiss."", ""Show him who's boss."", 'Nibble a little.', 'Be passionate.', 'Give him a little taste of what he can expect.', 'Use touch to show him what you have in mind.', 'A casual caress or even a firm grope can show him you mean business.', ""If he's not taking the hint, tell him exactly what you have in mind."", 'Guys will find that taking that kind of initiative is really sexy.', 'Just say something like, ""I\'m feeling pretty tense.', 'I think I could use a workout.', 'Do you want to get out of here and help me get a little exercise?"", If you change your mind, you can say no.', 'If at ANY TIME you feel uncomfortable, you can say no.', 'There is nothing wrong with that.', ""Do what's right for you and don't let someone guilt you into something you don't want to do."", ""Don't drive if you're drunk and don't let him drive if he's drunk."", ""You don't want this hook up to be to an IV in an ambulance."", 'You never know what could happen.', 'For your own safety, make sure your bestie or someone else you trust knows where you are.', 'Never leave your drink unattended and make sure you watch it being opened or poured.', ""Even if your guy is super awesome, that doesn't mean the other guys at the bar are."", 'Everybody wants their junk to stay healthy, right?', ""Even if you're a girl, have a condom for him to use."", ""And don't let him talk you into going without, even if you are on birth control."", ""Make sure you know how to put it on him (in case he doesn't know how or does it wrong)."", 'Again, you never know, so just make sure you have a phone ready to go with numbers for things like taxi services.', 'Or a friend if you want someone to talk to later.', 'You want to be the one to wake up first so that you can get out without making things too awkward.', ""Don't make a big deal out of hooking up."", ""You don't have anything to be ashamed of."", 'Just be calm and let yourself enjoy it.', 'Put yourself together and make sure all panties are accounted for.', ""Wash off your makeup quickly if it's all smudged and tie up or comb your hair into something that looks intentional."", 'You should also clean up any mess you guys made the night before as best you can without making too much noise.', ""Leave if you're at a hotel or make an excuse about needing to get him out of your place."", 'You want to clear out before things get too awkward, especially if either of you is new to the hook up.', ""You don't need to apologize to anyone about hooking up with a guy (unless you have a boyfriend, in which case, oops)."", ""Don't apologize to him."", ""You're just going to make both of you feel bad about something you don't need to feel bad about."", 'A quick kiss goodbye will help make sure everyone leaves with good memories.', 'Leave him your phone number if you want to leave the option open for a Round 2.']"

Be yourself. Have conversations with the popular guy. Make him feel helpful. Flirt. Be mysterious. Show off your skills. Build a social life on the Internet. Don't wait for him forever.,How to Impress a Popular Boy4,"Although you may be tweaking your appearance, never forget that your personality can be a powerful tool. Although a popular guy may like you for your appearance, he should also like you for who you are. Otherwise, it is not worth it. Despite how people think you should behave, be yourself and do what you enjoy. Becoming a fake, lifeless doll who relies on people's opinions is a bad direction.  Without taking any steps forward, you will not be able to progress in a relationship with him. By initiating a conversation and showing that you are confident in yourself, you will catch his attention and show him that you exist. If you remain in the background and only stare at him, he will not be interested in you and may think of you as creepy. Find the right times to talk to him:Use large group activities at school to your advantage. Show your intelligence and skills on projects, as this will impress him. Socialize with all the group members to prove that you are a social butterfly. This will also give you the excuse to talk to him. However, avoid placing your entire focus upon him, as this will cause you to appear desperate. Allow him to hang out with his friends, but occasionally drop by for a short conversation with him. After the project is over, continue talking to him once in a while. If he is interested in you, he'll eventually start initiating the conversations.Attend after-school meetings. Casual locations, such as the park or community swimming pool, are ideal as he may be alone or with a small group of friends. If you see him, wave and start a conversation about your plans and activities. However, avoid pulling him away for too long, as he may become annoyed.If he has a small sibling, show your kindness to him or her. This will show the popular guy that you are good with children. However, avoid being overly sweet and fake; otherwise, he may dislike you and feel that you are using his sibling to win his favor.Ask the popular guy about his interests. Show him that you are genuinely interested in his life. For example, if he plays football, ask him about last night's game. However, if his hobbies bore you, avoid spending too long on the topics, as your boredom will show. Instead, find common interests or activities that you both participate in.Compliment him. If he has a talent in a certain area that you didn't expect, offer him a genuine compliment. This may open up the path to a new conversation. However, avoid gushing over him or being overly sweet; otherwise, he may feel uncomfortable.  Accidentally drop your belongings, or ask him to reach an item on a shelf or locker for you. You could also ask for his help on a question or an assignment. However, avoid being needy and constantly asking for his help. You should also show him that you can be independent and strong without him. If you constantly cling to him, he may feel smothered and think of you as weak.  Boys are often attracted by a flirtatious girl who knows how to set the tone. Use subtle methods to show your attraction to him, such as twirling your hair, lowering your voice, or wearing slightly suggestive clothing. Wear semi-low, cute tops, as well as dresses or skirts that fall slightly above the knee. Occasionally bat your eyelashes, and don't hesitate to smile or wave to him. Have a confident walk as if you have places to be.  Although boys may be attracted by a flirtatious girl, they are often turned off by one who constantly throws herself at them. In order to set the mood and raise his interest in you, add an element of mysteriousness to your personality. Be secretive about certain aspects of your life. If he questions you about them, use slightly flirtatious lines, such as, ""I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you."" You could also drop hints about having a crush on a certain boy, but avoid revealing too much information.  Although you should avoid completely bragging about them, attract his attention by flaunting your intelligence and talents a little. Jog past him to show him how fast you are. Do your best in gym class, or show him your excellent skills on the computer. By proving to him that you are capable of different activities, you will be able to capture his interest.Beware of pushing your limits in skills that you are not good with. If he finds out that you are not as good as you claim, he may dislike you for lying.  Make sure that you are also well-connected outside of school. Add the popular guy on several social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Once in a while, send him friendly messages, which will let him know that you are thinking of him and that you care. Upload good photos of yourself, and make sure you look your best in them, as he could see them. However, avoid following all of his accounts; otherwise, you'll appear to be a stalker.If a friend tags you in a bad picture, untag it.

This is exactly what you want to look like if you want your crush to notice and approach you. Not smiling can make you look disinterested or even hostile.In one study, 60% of men described images of unsmiling women as “moody,” and 66% of women described unsmiling women as “disinterested.”As an added bonus, smiling and laughter can actually make you feel happier.With all of this in mind, you should still feel free to tell people to go jump in a lake if they ORDER you to smile! , Keep your back straight and chin up. Put your shoulders back, but not too far. This shows confidence and energy. Keep your legs and arms relaxed instead of crossing them. This conveys openness and friendliness.

Girls are often taught to sit back and wait to be approached, but it can be very attractive, and you can stand out from the crowd, if you speak up instead of waiting around.  Studies have shown again and again that grooming is the most important element of attractiveness. Shower often. You shouldn’t necessarily style your hair like you’re going to prom all the time, and don’t feel like you need to spend hours with the curling iron and hairspray, but be sure your hair looks clean.Sometimes the amount and type of grooming that you will do depends on the type of person you want to attract. Some people are more attracted to a rugged, outdoors type, while others prefer a more put-together appearance.Smell your best. Wear deodorant, and bathe regularly, but don’t overdo it on the perfume, body spray, or lotion. You don’t want to make your crush sneeze or get a headache because you are wearing too much scent.

You don’t have to hang attentively on every word, but make it clear that you care about what they are saying by nodding, smiling, and responding when appropriate. Ask questions about what they say. If your crush is telling you that he’s sad about his grandma dying, ask about what he liked to do with his grandma. If your crush is excited about her basketball game tonight, ask what position she plays.You’ll be especially glad that you listened carefully the next time you see your crush, because you’ll have a basis for conversation already. You may have even developed an inside joke with them, which can be great for creating lasting relationships.  This can help you learn more about your crush to help you determine whether you are truly compatible or not. It can also lead to increased interactions with your crush, which will make it more likely that they will notice you. Of course, there’s always the added bonus of making new friends too, even if your crush never notices you.  If you are particularly nervous around your crush, it might be hard to make conversation. Try to think of conversation topics before you see them. Think about what you have in common, who your common friends are, what upcoming events you might both be excited about (or dreading), and see if you can come up with a few different topics in your head.Joking around is a great way to interact with your crush, but be careful not to make jokes at the expense of others. You don’t want to seem like a bully or a mean person just to get someone’s attention.  You might want to start by asking them to be part of a group you’re organizing. This can be a group doing a school project or a group getting together to go to the movies. Just make it clear that you’re interested in having them around. After you’ve done some group activities together and feel comfortable, then ask them to do something with you one-on-one.Oddly enough, one study with over 1,000 participants found that people who rode rollercoasters found their non-romantic friends more attractive after a ride on a roller coaster than before. So maybe a trip to a fair or an amusement park is in order! , If you sit down next to your crush and your legs bump each other, pay attention to whether they jump away quickly or let their leg linger. If they let the touch continue, it’s possible that they are interested in you, so you might want to escalate the touch ever-so-slightly by casually letting your arm touch theirs the next time you’re at your lockers together.Don’t escalate until your crush reciprocates or lingers.They might also be super shy and feel terrified when their arm touches yours, so be respectful of their comfort level and don’t touch them if they seem uncomfortable. Even if they jump away when you touch, that doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t like you, so try some other tactics if you suspect that’s the case.  This is the hardest part! If you try to follow every piece of advice you have ever heard about getting someone to notice you, you may find that you feel fake or overwhelmed. When in doubt, just try to act as naturally as possible. Treat your crush like you treat your friends, and odds are good they’ll pay attention to you eventually.","['Eye contact shows that you’re paying attention and care about what a person is saying.',

"Flirt with him. Find ways to make physical contact. Smile, smile, smile. Be in the same place as him. Exchange looks in class. Work in compliments. Give him a gift. Call him more regularly. Mention to his friends that you like him. Get a feel for where he's at.",How to Hint to a Boy That You Like Him,"Dropping hints is a great way to start getting the message across if you are sure you want more than a friendship try having one thing and sharing it. If you have something in common with him, use it. There is no doubt about it, flirting is the key to opening the door to a new relationship. Of course, you need to make sure you are not overdoing it, but you also want to get the message across.When he says something funny to you, laugh! Only laugh if it's funny to you because you'd want him to know the real you. Still, even if his jokes aren't all hilarious, at least smile. Boys love seeing your smile. Just don't overdo it if you can help yourself. Be yourself at all times!Tease him every now and then. Don't make it too harsh though. Just give him a smirk and tell him he totally failed whatever he was trying to do. If he usually does it well, that's an okay time to tease him. But if he is working hard on it and just can't get it right, it's probably not the best idea to tell him he did poorly.Send him notes or put messages in his backpack. Write small things like ""I wish the day was done..."" or ""What are you doing for summer?"" Sending him notes will make him feel special and singled out by you.If you think it might work, give him a little wave with your hand. Don't be discouraged if he doesn't wave back. If he smiles back at you, you'll know it worked.If that doesn't get you noticed, try winking at him. Winking is a universal sign of affection. Make sure that you only close one eye when you wink, or else it might just look like you're blinking. , We all like our personal space, but we're eager to give it up when it comes to that special person. Touching him gently in social situations will signal that you don't just want to stay friends.Ask him for help on a math problem and brush your shoulder against his. Stay close to him for a while if he doesn't move away.Touch his forearm or his shoulder when you're talking to him. Don't grab hold of him like you're going to shake him; just tap him or rest a few fingers on him for a moment, and try to do it casuallyIf he wears glasses and you see that they are slid down a little then slowly and gently walk up and push them up to the top of his nose. As you do that rub your hand on his cheek and smile. Be gentle!! If he smiles that means he enjoyed it. If he backs you off then he's not interested or you pushed to rough.If you have a playful relationship with him, you can get away with more physical contact. Ask him for a piggyback ride (not when you're wearing a skirt!) or tickle him when he least expects it.  Be happy when you look at him, and try to project that happiness as much as possible. Being happy is attractive, and smiling is the way you show the world you're happy.Don't conceal your true smile. Remember that time you laughed so hard you couldn't breathe? Remember the smile that was plastered on your face afterwards? Show him that smile! Your confidence will be infectious.You can tell he's interested if he smiles back at you and tries to hold your eyes a bit longer than regular friends would. This means he gets pleasure out of feasting his eyes on you.Try smiling at him as you stroke your hair. This will bring his attention to both your great smile and your fantastic hair.  This can be difficult to do, but it will give you more chances to talk to him. The more you're around him, the more he'll take notice.In classes, if seating is optional, sit next to him every so often. Sit next to him at lunch when there's an opportunity.Join the clubs that he's in, unless they're something like boys' sports teams. Try to find clubs that you both like, so that you'll do fun activities together and enjoy yourself while you're at it.If he plays sports or does other activities, make it a priority to go to his games or see him perform. There's nothing like scoring that winning touchdown and seeing a cute girl in the stands.Be careful about being around him all the time. You don't want to look like a stalker, so be selective and play things off like they're random. Plus, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder.  When the two of you are in the same class, look at him from wherever you're sitting and when he looks back, turn away and blush. This sends him non-verbal information that you enjoy looking at him.Do not stare. You want him to think you're interested, not obsessed. Occasionally look his way, and if he isn't biting, don't sweat it. Send him a note or talk to him and see if he looks your way the next time.When he turns to you, look him in the eyes and smile. Remember, if he catches you looking at him, that means that he was looking at you, which means he probably likes you. Score!Always keep good eye contact when talking to him, even if he's shy. Show him how pretty your eyes are, and how he makes your eyes smile with delight. Keeping good eye contact shows him he's got your undivided attention, but also that you're one confident gal.  Be sincere about what you compliment, and don't make it seem cheesy. The best compliments say something sweet about a person's character.When he gets a haircut, for example, ask him where he got it. If you tell him you like it, you're saying that you like his style and paid attention enough to notice.Try complimenting aspects of his personality. Tell him he was loyal not to snitch on his friend, or sweet for giving up his lunch. Going beyond surface-level compliments is important.Try to work the compliment into a bigger conversation. If you just say, ""I love your shoes,"" he might not know how to react. Find a way to talk about shoes in general, and gradually let him know that you like his shoes more than his friend's, which are just ugly.  Give him something boyish and thoughtful. It might seem weird to give him a gift, but just pretend like you're giving it to your best friend.Whatever it is, make him think it wasn't a big deal by saying something like: ""I came across this and I thought about you.""Don't buy anything too extravagant or expensive. Get something small enough so that he won't feel like he has to get you something in return.Pick up an extra pack of gum, or that bottled juice that he always gets during recess. You might even get him a notebook or pens, especially if he always forgets them.If you don't mind asking him out, get him some tickets to a movie or sports event. Tell him, ""I thought we could go together.""Whatever gift you give, find out his interests first. You'll want to get him something that he actually likes — something that shows you're thinking about him and you like him for who he is.  Don't call him every day and talk to him for hours, but don't be afraid to take that next step and get to know him. Calling him is a sign that you're serious about getting to know him better.When you call him, find excuses to talk to him. Ask him what the homework was, what time the party is going to be, or what he knows about the latest cell phone. Be creative.Talk about something weird that happened in school, or something interesting about his life. Listen well and be sure to pick up on the little details that he mentions. Use them to build on old conversations and to bring up new ones.Exchange information and perspectives. This is your chance to get to know him, and his chance to get to know you. Talking on the phone can be enjoyable for boys if they feel funny and interesting doing it, so make sure to laugh at his jokes and sound excited.If he's not talkative, be sure to ask him lots of questions. Ask him what his parents do; where he grew up; what he wants to be later on; what his siblings are like; or where he wants to go on vacation. Asking question will help move along the conversation and tell him you're interested.Don't keep him on the phone for a long time; he might have other stuff to do. Always maintain a little mystery about yourself. You want him to get to know you, but you also want to leave him curious about learning even more.  This is risky, because his friends may distort information or tease him (don't worry, they're jealous!), so you have to be careful about who you tell. But sooner or later, his friends will bring it up to him, and the ball will be in his court.Use this as a kind of last resort. If all the above steps don't work, consider telling his friends. Again, you will have little/no control over what his friends tell him.Don't tell his friends that you want them to pass it along. Just find a way to mention it to at least one of his friends — they'll most likely do the rest.If you really trust them, tell your friend to ""accidentally"" spill it to him. Because this is tough to do, have someone who is really casual do this. If they don't do it casually, it can feel like you're demanding him to make a decision about you. You want him to feel flattered, not caught in a corner.  You can try indirect flirting all you want, but it might not have an effect. Sometimes guys need you to spell things out really clearly.Ask him to walk with you after class is done. If he says he doesn't know, nudge a little more and say, ""You're going to leave me all by myself?"" If he says he can't, he's not interested. If he says he can, try to flirt with him when you are walking together at the end of he day. If he says yes immediately, he's definitely interested.Ask him if he wants to be your date to a dance, especially if it's Sadie Hawkins. If he says yes, plan what you want to wear together so that you can be color-coordinated.Ask him if he'll carry your heavy backpack for a little while. It doesn't need to be all day, but tell him that it's hurting your back and that he looks strong enough to carry it. If he says yes, he's definitely into you and likes that you think he's manly.","['Dropping hints is a great way to start getting the message across if you are sure you want more than a friendship try

It'll put a guy in a little pickle if he's asked if he likes a girl he doesn't even know. Try this: when your friend isn't looking, knock one of her books off of her desk.

Now he'll know who you're talking about when you ask if he likes your friend. , If you stalk him, showering him with questions, he'll probably be a little freaked out. This is a turn-off.

"Smile. Look out for him in the halls, and wave at him when you see him. Try to sit near to him at lunch. Ask him out on a group date. Use friendly fun body language to show you like him.

Don't give him a big cheesy grin; just a soft, sweet smile will do just the trick. , Don't swat as if you're trying to get a fly off the ceiling, just give a small, cute, fluttery-fingered wave that lets him know that you're glad to see him. If he smiles, you're making progress.  If you can't sit at the same table, just sit at a table nearby and make lots of eye contact -- maybe wink once or twice if you're feeling like playfully showing him how cute you think he is.  If you're going somewhere with friends, don't be afraid to invite him along! Just casually say ""Oh, me and a bunch of friends are going *insert activity here*. Wanna come?"" He'll probably say yes.

Answering yes to these questions suggests that he might be someone you would hit it off with. , Be yourself!Definitely don't pretend to be a big fan of, for example, his favourite band if you have never heard of them. Instead ask questions like 'What kind of music do they play?' 'Have you seen them play live?' 'What's your favourite song?'. Take an interest in the band.

"Do what you love, and let your passion show. Dress to impress. Consider where the guy spends his time. Catch his eye. Consider getting to know the guy's friends. Be respectful of a guy's space.",How to Get Guys to Notice You1,"Whether you're an athlete, an artist, a singer, or a writer: spend time doing what makes you happy. The first step to getting noticed is feeling (or at least appearing) confident and comfortable in your own shoes.If you're in your element, you won't feel so self-conscious. Confidence is attractive, and guys can often tell when you're comfortable with yourself. Focus on doing what you love, and the rest will follow.Have a good time with your friends. Laugh a lot. Guys may find you more attractive if you seem like you're fun to be with.Relationships often sprout from common ground. If you spend time doing what you love, you're more likely to find someone who shares your passions. , When you know you're going to see the guy, wear your cutest outfit. He may notice your outfit, and he may not--but you will likely feel more confident, and that can make all the difference.Consider wearing clothes that the guy might relate to. If you're crushing on a guy who's into music, wear a band t-shirt. If you're crushing on a guy who's into sports, wear a shirt or jersey with the name of his favorite team. If the guy sees that you have interests in common, he may be more likely to think of you.You don't need to wear revealing clothing to impress a guy. In fact, many guys may be turned off by ""trashy"" clothing that reveals too much. Respect yourself and consider the social consequences of what you wear.Consider wearing makeup, but don't overdo it. A little makeup goes a long way. Ask your mother, your older sister, or another female relative for advice if you haven't applied makeup before.  Join clubs, teams, or groups that he has joined, and put yourself into a position to grow close to him. Make it a natural process.If a guy is involved in the science club, consider joining the science club. Only do this if you are genuinely interested in the science club; this approach only works if you can impress him by being as passionate about his hobby as he is.If a guy runs for your school's track team, consider joining the team. Again, only do this is you are genuinely interested in track. You don't want to be noticed for the wrong reasons.If a guy is in a band, consider going to his shows. Get to know the scene and compliment him on his music.  From time to time, gaze over in his direction. When he notices you, discreetly lock eyes with him for a moment, then look away.Smile coyly, if you're feeling bold. Research indicates that guys are more likely to approach girls when they are given clear signals that their interest is returned; smiling will subtly tell him that you're interested.After you lock eyes, don't look over at him for a while. Repeat occasionally. He may begin to glance over at you more often to see if you are looking at him.Avoid looking at him too often. Be flirtatious, but don't be creepy.  If you have mutual friends, spending more time with them can be a great way to grow closer to your crush.If his friends like you and see that the two of you have chemistry together, they may help convince him to go for you.Be careful: sometimes, getting deep into a guy's social circle can complicate matters. If you share too many of the same friends, your crush may be afraid that asking you out will disrupt the friend group. He may worry about the complications that could ensue if the two of you break up down the line.Be aware that if you grow close to a guy's friends, some of them may fall for you instead. If you aren't open to this, be careful with your flirtation.  It is one thing to move in the same circles as someone; it is another thing to follow him around. Stay true to yourself, your friends, and your interests, even as you make an effort to get close to him.Be forward, but not forceful; don't push yourself upon him.

Whenever you approach your crush, whether you bump into him at a store, at school with friends or by yourself, or just anywhere, stay and remain calm and focus your attention on something else.

Get to know him better. Do things for yourself. Be flirty. Hug. Don't wear too much make-up. Don't change yourself for a guy. Kiss. Be playful. Flirt. DON'T try to make him jealous. Hang out with his friends. Keep eye contact. Mirror him. Be honest with him. Tease him. Break the touch barrier. Get him to laugh. Be nice.,How to Get a Shy Guy to Like You in Middle School,"Become his friend, and gain his trust. If he can trust you, then that's great!;, Make sure you can do some things on your own, rather than being 'wimpy', but also don't try to act really 'tough'.  Be a little flirty with him, but not to much, until you really get to know him better.  Once you get to know him better, you can open your arms and greet him with a hug... If he says no, but you happen to know he likes you, then it's because he's too shy to give you a hug... but he will be wishing for a hug later on, even if he denies a hug. But still, give him some personal space if he REALLY protests against it. Or just give him surprise hugs.  Ever. If he likes make-up, you can put on a little extra, but if not, then try limiting the make-up you put on. If you don't wear any make-up, then that's fine too. Lots of guys like natural beauty.  Pretty simple. If you change for every single guy, then you're not yourself. Just be yourself.  After you know him for quite a while, and you're great friends, you could give him a quick kiss if you're sure he likes you. Just a quick one, not a big kiss or anything.  Playing different games, even if they may seem stupid or silly.  Poke him, hug him, wink at him, do whatever... If you're really, REALLY brave, you could do bigger things, such as play footsies or tickling him or having him tickle you or both. Do whatever. Be creative.  If you like him, don't expect him to like you back if you try to make him jealous. If he sees you with other guys, chances are that you honestly don't like him and that he won't or will stop liking you.  But don't be around them more than with him, or he could feel that you like them more than him. Also remember that if his friends don't like you, that they could influence him to dislike you.  If you make eye contact with him, keep it for just a few extra seconds. Too long and it can seem awkward. Too short and it seems like nothing. But keeping eye contact for a few extra seconds, then smiling, is good.  To be close to him on a certain level, mirror certain things he does, or copy them. Not all the time, but just occasionally do things that would be normal for you both to do, to connect on a certain level.  Never be distrustful, and always stay honest with him- If he deserves it, which he probably does, then ALWAYS be honest. ALWAYS. Make sure you both are always honest and open with each other.  Not in a mean way, but in a more playful way. Make sure he can tease back, and that you both enjoy the teasing as a joke.  Touch him, poke him, just touch him in general. If you don't want to openly touch him, just lightly have your arms brush against each other, on 'accident'. Or, run your hand up his leg, whether by accident or on purpose. Pretty much just touch him anywhere. This will develop a closer bond between you both, and could make him like you more than ever before. Start with small 'accidental' touches and then move up.

Introduce yourself. Use social media to your advantage. Develop a friendship first.,How to Get Guys to Notice You2,"A guy will be more likely to notice you and remember you if he knows who you are.

Take advantage of this proximity; spend time with him and build a friendship.Make a joke, or comment on an interest that the two of you share. If you're in the same class, ask him about the homework. If he's wearing a band t-shirt, ask him about the band.  Getting to know someone online can mitigate much of the initial awkwardness. If you've gotten to know each other a bit in person, consider adding him on Facebook (or any site that you frequent).Once you're friends online, consider striking up a conversation over instant-messaging.

"Say ""hi"". Find ways to be around him. Make him look your way. Acknowledge him. Have deeper conversations. Look over at him a couple times. Be cool when he talks to you.",How to Get a Hot Guy Neighbor to Notice You,"This requires courage, but it's a surefire way for him to at least know that you exist. If he's new to the neighborhood, go over and say a quick hello. Introduce yourself and welcome him to the neighborhood. Tell him where you live; ie. ""Hi, I'm Miranda. I just live in the house across the street. I just thought I'd stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood."";, When he is outside, go outside at the same time. Make sure that you're not just standing there staring at him; you'll need a reason to be outside, such as doing yard work, washing the car, playing, etc. so it seems like a coincidence that you're outside at the same time. The last thing you want is for him to think that you're a creepy stalker.  Give him a reason to - play with a friend/sibling, play a very loud game, listen to your favorite song (and sing along if you're confident enough), etc. Doing this will make him start to notice you.  If you walk by his house and see him, or vice versa, be sure to say something. You don't have to get into a huge conversation; a simple ""Hi"", ""Good morning"", or ""Good afternoon"" will do the trick. Once he gets used to you greeting him, he will be the one saying hello first.  After a while, begin to actually talk to him. Saying things like ""How are you?"", ""What's up?"", ""Hey, neighbor!"", etc. will give him the opportunity to talk to you more, so you can learn more about him. This will help you two get closer.  Once he's really started to notice you, feel free to look over at him. If he catches you, instead of looking away, smile and wave at him. He'll most likely smile and wave back!, Once he's noticed you, he'll probably initiate a conversation or two. When this happens, be cool. Talk to him like you would any normal person.

"Make a funny or playful observation to break the ice. Show him that you are enjoying yourself in conversation. Be confident in who you are, and enjoy yourself in his company. Hang out with other people who bring out the best version of you with him. Follow him on social media. Post things on your social media. Comment on his posts. Move on if he doesn’t seem interested in you.",How to Get a Guy to Always Want to Talk to You1,"One way to break the ice is to pay attention to what is going on around you. Find something in your environment that you can make a funny comment about. For example, if it is lunch and the food hasn’t arrived yet and you two are waiting outside in the heat, you can something silly like, “Do you think they going to get us water for this wait, or do they just want us to die?” Guys find playfulness attractive in girls, and it will give you something to make a little bond over.Even if you don’t think of yourself as a funny person, you can still be playful.This playfulness can help make the conversation fun and low pressure.Remember that getting the conversation started is most important thing. Don’t worry too much about how the ice breaker goes. Focus instead on continuing your conversation. , One way to get a guy to like talking to you is if you seem like you are having a good time talking with him. A few ways you can show you are having fun is if you make eye contact, smile often, laugh genuinely, and lean forward slightly when you are talking. When you are talking, tilt your head to one side, smile and touch your hair, neck or clothes. But don’t over think it, just do what feels natural as well. Your nonverbal signals should just show him that you are having a good time.Let him know you like messaging with him if you are mostly messaging. For example, you can say something like, “I think you’re pretty fun to text with.”, Write down the things that make you awesome. Knowing why you are awesome and not being afraid to show it attracts others. Do not be afraid to make mistakes around him. Be authentic to the real you, quirks and all. Relax and laugh when you make mistakes, everyone does.Do not act like someone you think that he would like instead of being yourself. Imagine if someone were acting in a certain way to please you, would you like that? Probably not.  Enjoy laughing and hanging out with other people in his company. Showing him that you are fun, independent and have your own friends is important to establish.This will show him that friends are important to you and will help him see what you are in like with other people.It could make him a little jealous (in a good way) and maybe he’ll want to hang out with you more than before.  If you don’t have a social media account and he is active on social media, get an account. Like or retweet something that he has posted. If you are both on your social media, this could be a good way to start talking. Liking and retweeting things he posts on his social media can help build up your friendship and give you an idea of the things he likes. Also, liking his posts will help you to know what is going on with him.After liking a couple of things that he has posted, you should write a comment on a post or send him a message.Do not like everything he posts. Choose one or two things that you genuinely like, and space out the time between your likes to every few days. If you send too much attention to him, it may come off like you are trying too hard or creepy.  If you have been liking or commenting on his posts, post things that shows him what you are into. He should see your interests just as much as you should see his. For example, share beautiful or interesting pictures that you have taken, or find funny gifs, pictures or quotes from the internet which you can post along with a comment about why you like it.For example, if he writes a lot of posts about bands he likes and there is a band you both like, you can post one of the band’s music videos or the lyrics from one of their songs with a comment about why you like it.Stay true to yourself. Only post things that you genuinely like and are a part of who you are. It can come off fake if you are posting about things you haven’t shown any interest in before.  You should make a comment on a post that he writes early after it has been posted. If you write the comment early, he will be more likely to respond. Consider praising the post, asking a question about it, or commenting about something you find interesting. For example, if he writes a post about going to a show of the band you like, you can respond by saying, “I am so jealous you got to see them! Did you think they were good live?”.Avoid commenting too often. Make sure to space out your comments.  If he seems distant or aloof and isn’t responding to you much, he may not be interested. Luckily, there will be other guys who will want to talk to you and who you can have a great connection with.

Ask him his opinions on things that you have in common. Playfully disagree and banter with him. Avoid asking him questions he already knows the answer to. Boost his confidence. Learn how and when to end a conversation. Follow up with texts or messages regularly.,How to Get a Guy to Always Want to Talk to You2,"After you have made your first connections, you want to continue messaging him and having conversations to keep the connection you have made with him strong. One way to make your connection stronger and keep your conversation interesting is to ask him his opinions on things.Whatever you have in common, be it books, movies, food, etc, think about good questions to ask him that are open ended and will start interesting conversation. For example, if you both love Harry Potter, you can ask, “So what do you think is the best Harry Potter book?” And feel free to completely agree or disagree with him. These kinds of disagreements can lead to banter and can be pretty fun to have.You can start by telling him something that you have an opinion of and then ask his opinion on it. This question can also be related to the context of where you are or what you are doing. For example, if you are eating an apple at lunch, you could say, “I think that Granny Smith are the best apples period, but out of curiosity, what kind of apple is your favorite?” Once again, being playful is a good way to make your conversation more fun, especially when you are talking about simple topics and just getting your conversation going.Come up with a few different questions you can ask him before you talk to him because topics of conversation can go more quickly than you realize.  He will want to keep talking to you if you have fun when you talk. An example of banter is if you raise an eyebrow when he tells you that his favorite apple is Red Delicious, and you say something silly like, “You are saying you like Red Delicious apples best? Well I guess we can’t all be perfect.” Guys like this kind of silly banter because it is low pressure and fun. Banter is great because you two don’t have to talk about anything in particular, but you are still making a connection.Practice bantering with your friends and family. Find silly things to disagree with them on. Playfully disagreeing can be good for your other relationships too.  Try not to use small talk or getting to know you questions like “What’s going on?” or “So where are you from?”. These questions are not very interesting and you won’t learn much about him because he may give you an answer that he has already used many times before. You want him to come away from this conversation excited to talk to you again, so stay away from small talk.  Everyone wants to feel good about themselves, and if you can provide that for him, he will most likely want to keep talking to you. So get good at telling him why you like him with small, genuine compliments. You don’t have to make it a big deal- you can casually tell him why he is great. In fact, avoid making a big show of it. For example, while you are walking somewhere and if you notice he is usually good with directions, you can say “I like that you always seem to know how to get us where we are going.” , One way to keep your guy wanting to talk to you more is if you leave the conversation at the right time. The best way to end a conversation is to first find a place after you have made good connections and before the conversation has started to wind all the way down. Then think about why you need to get home, and after you have laughed or made a connection about something, let him know you need to get going. Make sure you tell him you really enjoyed yourself and look forward to talking to him again.Be casual and cool when you end the conversation. Say something like “Hey, it was so fun talking to you. I think I need to get home and get on my homework, but I really look forward to hanging out with you soon.”Make good eye contact with him when you leave. Let your eye contact linger a second longer and smile at him a little brighter or slyer when you do.  Depending on your conversation style and the guy you like, regularly can mean different things. Start messaging him every couple of days, and if he is prompt or slow with his answers, you can message more often or less often. Send him playful or funny comments or questions that engage him.For example, ask him for updates on how things are going. You can ask him something like, “Hey, how is that midterm paper coming?”.Or tell him about something interesting that happened to you or that relates to him from your day.

Do side by side activities with him. Get to know about his interests and the important relationships in his life. Find a quiet place for a conversation where you won’t be interrupted. Express yourself back to him. Be there during hard times as a confidant. Ask him for help.,How to Get a Guy to Always Want to Talk to You3,"Some guys bond with people by doing things instead of through talking. He might feel closer to you if you do side by side activities together. Examples of side by side activities would be playing sports, playing a game, or working on a project together. Pay attention to the kinds of activities that he likes to do, and do those activities with him. For example, if he likes to do outdoors activities like shooting, have him teach you how to shoot a gun. Or if there is a game that he likes to play, learn how to play too.Even if you don’t know how to do the activities that he likes to do, it can mean a lot to him if you try to learn.Enjoy yourself while you are out with him. Laugh aloud at your mistakes, ask lots of questions, and talk to the other people who are doing the activity too.Even if he is a guy who enjoys talking, it might build your relationship in a new way if you do side by side activities together.  Some guys do feel connected with girls based on their feelings and talking, and even guys who may not be always excited to talk about their feelings may want to talk to you about the things they care about once they are really comfortable with you. After you have spent quality time getting to know him, you should move on to getting to know him on a deeper level. He will feel closer to you and rely on you more if you know more about what he cares about and the history of his life.These kinds of conversations are great to have at night. You should ask him questions about important times in his past, the important relationships in his life, and the things he cares about.For example, you can ask him, “Which of your interests means the most to who you are, and why do you care so much about it?” Or ask him, “Who in your family do you think you are the closest with and why?”. These questions can be really simple but listening well will help you have a really meaningful conversation with him.  For your conversation, sit across from him or in a position where you can see his face and hear him well. Ask him questions about him and use the following listening skills to have a great conversation with him.Show him in your body posture that you are listening. Make eye contact, nod your head and react to him with small noises or gestures while he is speaking.Give him the right amount of distance. If you stand too close, you may come off as overly interested and stifling while standing too far away will make you seem distant. Give him space to talk but position yourself so that you can hear and see him well.Restate the main idea of what he is saying. This will let him know that you really understand the point what he is saying. If he is talking about his frustrating day, for example, you can summarize the most important parts of what he has said so far. For example, you could say, “So you are saying that you didn’t understand why your brother was acting up until you saw what was going on with him at school.”Be empathetic to his feelings. Empathy means you can understand the feeling that he experienced even if you do not share a common feeling. For example, you can combine restating his main idea and being empathetic by saying something like, “You must have felt so frustrated to have to retake that test after you studied so hard the first time.” It is important to tell him that you understand the feelings he has and the reasons why he feels the way he does.  Don’t forget to put yourself out there, too. If you really like him, you could feel shy talking about yourself, but he will build a better connection with you if you can talk to him about the things that you care about, too. Tell him about the important relationships in your life, the big experiences that you are going through, and the good things that you love in your life. As before, make eye contact with him when you talk, use your gestures to express your feelings, and let your tone of voice express what you mean. He will be better able to connect and care for you when he is able to understand what important stuff that is going on with you.  Everyone needs someone to lean on during hard times. If you can be that person for him, you will build a really strong bond that will make him feel close to you. There are lots of things you can do to be there for him in hard times. For example, if you know he has been struggling with his grades and is going to have a difficult conversation with his teacher, send him a text encouraging him before he goes into talk. You can say something like, “Good luck- I know you’ll be able work it out because you always do.” Then after his talk with his teacher ask him how it went, and let him know you are there if he wants to talk.Sometimes people would rather be distracted when they are going through something hard. In that case, send him funny texts that make him laugh.If he tells you that he is having a hard time with something, ask him if he wants to get together and talk about it. Or you can let him know that you are there for him if he just wants to hang out and chill.If you can be there for him during hard times, this will make your connection deeper and make him more likely to go to you the next time something good or bad happens with him.  Guys like it when they feel needed. If something is going on with you that you need help with, let him know, and ask for his help in advance. For example, if you need help painting posters after school for a club, ask him if there is a day he is available to help you. When he gets there make sure that you have something for him to do. Accomplishing tasks together is a great way to bond people together in new ways.","['Some guys bond with people by doing things instead of through talking.', 'He might feel closer to you if you do

"Smile. Be funny. Be clean and healthy. Try to be cool and popular. Dress nicely. Know your best features. Be confident. Forgive and forget, don't remind!,When you're trying to get a guy to like you, you shouldn't act jealous, that's a major turn off. Never feel that you need to change for a guy!",How to Get a Boy to Like You (Teens),"Relationship experts have proven that smiling is the easiest way to say ""I'm interested"" or that you are easy to approach. Guys love a great smile. , Don't be a phony funny, be genuine. Guys are attracted to girls that have a 'funny bone'. Being funny doesn't mean laughing at everything, or acting dumb, cause that is just a turn off to guys. Instead, joke around, and/or tell funny stories that happened to you or a friend.  If you have blemishes or large pores help them go down by washing your face with warm water and soap, finishing with cold water to close pores. Eat lots of fruits and veggies. Get rid of all junk food, cause all it is doing is ruining your insides and outsides. Make sure you drink 8 glasses of water every day! This will flush out(Get rid) of toxins inside your body. Take showers everyday and brush your teeth. Brushing your teeth will also let him be able to come up to you without holding his breath.  Have lots of friends. Guys like when girls have friends, that way they know you are approachable and friendly.  Wearing something cute and flirty is what most guys are attracted to. Maybe a skirt with a flouncy shirt and some cute flats with a headband That is sure to grab his attention.  Wearing makeup is something a lot of girls may choose to do. You don't have to, all it does is accentuates things. Guys usually prefer girls to wear simple things like blush and lip gloss. If you have blemishes you can cover them with concealer or a powder. Eyeliner is good for showing off the depth and angles of your eyes. Blush is good for showing off and accentuating your cheek bones. Lip gloss is just for some extra sparkle.  Sometimes it's hard to feel confident on things like bad hair days, but every guy likes his girl to keep her head held high, and not worry about what others are saying, as long as you stay true to yourself. If you are having, say, a bad hair day, then just forget about hair and wear an extremely cute outfit, or makeup look, or vice versa. Also, don't be afraid to speak your mind (but don't be rude or snotty).  Most guys hate when they do something wrong, so if he happens to say something about you or do something wrong, but he apologizes, then you should forgive him. But if he constantly does it, you have the right to not forgive him. Also, if a guy did something wrong awhile ago, don't bring it up again! That makes guys cringe and it's a huge turn off.  If you are trying to make him jealous with another guy you need to be subtle and not to clingy. Guys will chase after you, if they really want you. So, making him a little jealous can't hurt anyone.  You're not going to marry him, you're only a teenager. So never change for a guy. Make sure he is the right guy for you and if not move on.","['Relationship experts have proven that smiling is the easiest way to say ""I\'m interested"" or that you are easy to approach.', 'Guys love a great smile.', "", Don't be a phony funny, be genuine."", ""Guys are attracted to girls that have a 'funny bone'."", ""Being funny doesn't mean laughing at everything, or acting dumb, cause that is just a turn off to guys."", 'Instead, joke around, and/or tell funny stories that happened to you or a friend.', 'If you have blemishes or large pores help them go down by washing your face with warm water and soap, finishing with cold water to close pores.', 'Eat lots of fruits and veggies.', 'Get rid of all junk food, cause all it is doing is ruining your insides and outsides.', 'Make sure you drink 8 glasses of water every day!', 'This will flush out(Get rid) of toxins inside your body.', 'Take showers everyday and brush your teeth.', 'Brushing your teeth will also let him be able to come up to you without holding his breath.', 'Have lots of friends.', 'Guys like when girls have friends, that way they know you are approachable and friendly.', 'Wearing something cute and flirty is what most guys are attracted to.', 'Maybe a skirt with a flouncy shirt and some cute flats with a headband That is sure to grab his attention.', 'Wearing makeup is something a lot of girls may choose to do.', ""You don't have to, all it does is accentuates things."", 'Guys usually prefer girls to wear simple things like blush and lip gloss.', 'If you have blemishes you can cover them with concealer or a powder.', 'Eyeliner is good for showing off the depth and angles of your eyes.', 'Blush is good for showing off and accentuating your cheek bones.', 'Lip gloss is just for some extra sparkle.', ""Sometimes it's hard to feel confident on things like bad hair days, but every guy likes his girl to keep her head held high, and not worry about what others are saying, as long as you stay true to yourself."", 'If you are having, say, a bad hair day, then just forget about hair and wear an extremely cute outfit, or makeup look, or vice versa.', ""Also, don't be afraid to speak your mind (but don't be rude or snotty)."", 'Most guys hate when they do something wrong, so if he happens to say something about you or do something wrong, but he apologizes, then you should forgive him.', 'But if he constantly does it, you have the right to not forgive him.', ""Also, if a guy did something wrong awhile ago, don't bring it up again!"", ""That makes guys cringe and it's a huge turn off."", 'If you are trying to make him jealous with another guy you need to be subtle and not to clingy.', 'Guys will chase after you, if they really want you.', ""So, making him a little jealous can't hurt anyone."", ""You're not going to marry him, you're only a teenager."", 'So never change for a guy.', 'Make sure he is the right guy for you and if not move on.']"

Use inviting body language. Smile. Be confident in yourself. Make eye contact. Start a conversation with him.,How to Get a Boy's Phone Number in Middle School1,"As you can imagine, it can be nerve-wracking for a guy to ask for your number or to ask you out, especially in middle school when girls are maturing faster than boys.

Confidence is so important because it means that YOU know your value; and a guy can never take that from you. So value who you are, and be don’t be afraid to be yourself.  Direct eye contact is a great way to get a guy’s attention, because they can’t misread it. You want to connect with him, and you’re not afraid to show it.

You’ll already be comfortable with him and you can get a sense for how he feels about you.Compliment him. Whether it’s something he’s wearing or his eyes, a compliment tells him you’re taking notice in him.Let him do most of the talking. Ask him questions about himself. Pay attention and be genuinely interested.If he turns the conversation to you, try to avoid going into detail and then change the subject. You can also tell him you have to go (even if you don’t).

"Embrace your feelings for him, then let them go. Talk about your feelings with a friend, a relative, or a counselor. Remind yourself that this crush is just another fish in the sea. Learn from the experience. Avoid him for a while. Keep conversations to a minimum, for a while. Stop checking his social media profiles for updates. Get rid of things that remind you of him. Focus on what's important in your life. Take some time to center yourself before pursuing another guy. Learn how to interact with the guy on a platonic level.",How to Forget About the Guy You Like,"Accept the grief, sadness, loneliness, regret, anxiety, guilt, insecurity, or other negative emotions in the order they come to you. Let yourself be sad, and let yourself heal. Ultimately, the surest path to getting over someone is to be honest with yourself. , Don't bottle up your emotions. Ask your support system for advice, and try to understand what went wrong. If you aren't sure what to do next, these people may have the wisdom and insight to guide you.Talk to parents, older siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents – anyone that you feel comfortable asking for insight. You may even feel comfortable asking a favorite teacher or a leader in your community.Be careful who you trust. If you are spilling your guts to someone for whom your crush is a mutual friend, make sure that this person won't pass along what you say. It may be harder to get over the guy if there's gossip floating around.  Consider that there are hundreds of thousands—even millions—of people with whom you can fall in love. He may seem like the one, but this doesn't mean that he is the only one. Nor does it mean you'll never find someone like him again.  Think about why this crush didn't work out. Maybe you were into him, but he wasn't into you; maybe he was in a relationship already, or he had eyes for someone else; maybe you said something to turn him off, or he did something that made you decide that he was bad news. Whatever the circumstances, you cannot take back what has happened. You can only absorb this, learn from it, and grow.Think about what you would have done differently. You might be able to successfully navigate a crush situation in the future by analyzing what went wrong with this guy.Think about the sort of person that you want to pursue. Maybe this guy just wasn't right for you, even if you found yourself attracted to him. Consider which qualities will guide your future crushes, and which personality traits you want to avoid.  If you know where he hangs out at lunch, avoid that area altogether. Find a new way. You may wind up thinking about him even more if you walk near him or you see him talking with someone else. If you're going to forget about him, you can't keep hanging around.If you have mutual friends, consider spending less time with that particular group until you're sure that you're over him. If you don't want to give up your social circle, try focusing your attention on other members of the group instead.It may be hard to avoid this guy if you have classes together, you work together, or you are frequently drawn together by other commitments (clubs, teams, etc.). Again, try to focus your attention on other members of that group, or try to interact with the guy in a platonic way.  If he tries to talk to you, don't let yourself fall under his spell. Try not to fully engage in the conversation; give him short answers, and slip away as soon as you can. You don't need to be rude – you just might have an easier time forgetting about him if you aren't always talking to him. Bear in mind that if you have mutual friends or mutual obligations, you may eventually need to learn to interact with him in a platonic way.  It's hard to forget about someone if they're constantly popping up in your peripheral awareness. ""Facebook stalking"" this guy will keep you emotionally attached to him, but it won't make him feel the same way – and it isn't healthy to fixate on something unattainable. This will take discipline, but it will keep you grounded in the long run.If you're friends with him on Facebook, but you don't want to unfriend him, consider stopping notifications on his posts. This way, none of his photos or statuses will show up in your Newsfeed.Train yourself not to wonder about him. Whenever you catch yourself reading one of his updates, stop yourself and keep scrolling. Let go of him and focus on the next thing. Eventually, you may be able to completely disengage your interest from him.  This might include pictures of the two of you together, or a CD that he gave you, or a pen that you let him borrow – anything that keeps you thinking about him. If the things belong to him, give them back. If the things belong to you, give them away to a friend or a donation center. Let these reminders slip from your life, and you may find it much easier not to think about your crush.  If you are constantly fixating upon what your crush is doing, you will find it much harder to forget him. Think about what demands your focus right now: maybe you have a big test coming up, or an exciting trip, or a big game this weekend. Try to divert your attention away from your crush so that you can move on. Throw yourself into your hobbies, your passions, and your obligations, and try to keep your mind engaged in the present.If you can't think of anything big that's coming up, try to focus on things that you can look forward to each day. Think about how lucky you are to be able to eat lunch with your friends on a daily basis. Think about the satisfaction that you get from practicing music, or practicing a sport, and feeling yourself gradually improve.  If you have an especially rough time getting over this guy, you might want to take at least a few weeks to bring your emotions back into balance. Focus on school, on sports, friends, hobbies – focus on anything that you love. Try to bring yourself back in line with your non-relationship goals.When you find yourself drawn to a new guy, ask yourself whether you are ready. It can be a wonderful experience to let yourself fall for someone, but make sure that you are prepared for the emotional ride.Be careful not to simply replace your crush with another guy. Ask yourself, and be honest: are you shifting your feelings onto this new guy without giving yourself time to get over the first guy? If so, consider taking it slow.Some people advocate the ""rebound"" strategy: find a guy for whom you have a purely physical attraction, and don't let it get too serious. You will need to decide what's best for you – but be careful not to play with someone else's feelings as a way to deflect your own pain.  You will know that you have fully moved on when you can hold a normal, non-self-conscious conversation with this guy. Try to change your emotional association with him from ""crush"" to ""friend"". You may not work well as romantic partners, but you may find that you become great friends! If you are already friends with the guy, and you don't want to throw that friendship away, you will need to learn how to be platonic.","['Accept the grief, sadness, loneliness, regret, anxiety, guilt, insecurity, or other negative emotions in the order they come to you.', 'Let yourself be sad, and let yourself heal.', 'Ultimately, the surest path to getting over someone is to be honest with yourself.', "", Don't bottle up your emotions."", 'Ask your support system for advice, and try to understand what went wrong.', ""If you aren't sure what to do next, these people may have the wisdom and insight to guide you."", 'Talk to parents, older siblings, aunts, uncles, grandparents – anyone that you feel comfortable asking for insight.', 'You may even feel comfortable asking a favorite teacher or a leader in your community.', 'Be careful who you trust.', ""If you are spilling your guts to someone for whom your crush is a mutual friend, make sure that this person won't pass along what you say."", ""It may be harder to get over the guy if there's gossip floating around."", 'Consider that there are hundreds of thousands—even millions—of people with whom you can fall in love.', ""He may seem like the one, but this doesn't mean that he is the only one."", ""Nor does it mean you'll never find someone like him again."", ""Think about why this crush didn't work out."", ""Maybe you were into him, but he wasn't into you;

Walk by him in the hall. Try to catch his eye. Find a reason to talk to him.

Your conversation may also catch his attention.You may want to practice walking at home until you feel comfortable.  After you have done a few “walk-bys,” the next phase in your plan should be to try and lock eyes with him for a few seconds. This might be his first clue that you are interested in him.

Just lock eyes for three seconds and then look away.Glance at him the next time you walk by.Try to catch his eyes during class.Smile if you see him at an assembly or in the lunchroom.  Once you have successfully made eye contact, you need to find reasons to talk to him. Fortunately, school provides lots of opportunities for that.

Make strong eye contact. Keep conversations light. Use touch. Just go for it.,How to Get a Guy to Notice You at School3,"Once you have been able to strike up a conversation with this guy, you can move on to actually flirting. An important element of flirtation is making strong eye contact. This is different from just catching his eye from across the hall. When you are flirting, you want to:Maintain his gaze while you are talking.Keep your gaze soft.Smile and/or laugh.  Your early conversations should be simple, effortless, and brief. Your goal is to keep him wanting more, so you should avoid giving him too much of you at once. Avoid digging into heavy emotional, political, or stressful topics. Avoid complaining or ranting. Instead, talk about something funny or look for things you have in common (like sports, fashion, spring break plans).Keep early interactions short and sweet. You can say, ""I have that same notebook.""You can brainstorm a short, funny story ahead of time. For example, try saying, ""That reminds me of this time I went to San Jose.""When in doubt, use compliments! Such as, “Wow, you’re really good at math.”, If you are talking and feeling great, it might be time to “break the touch barrier.” In other words, you can really communicate that you like someone by using nonchalant touch!

Rather than waiting around for him to notice you, take the plunge and ask him out. If it seems like he is interested in you, go ahead and make the first move.

"Casually approach him and strike up a small conversation. Get in contact with him on a social network. Attempt to talk to him a few times a week. Gauge his feelings and drop hints that you like him. Make physical contact after awhile, but be sure he's okay with it. Ask him out. Keep the date simple if he agrees. Every person has an ego.

Throw a small party and invite a few people you know he'll be comfortable with.",How to Get a Shy Guy,"Remember, shy people are just like everyone else except with a wall, like I said; they won't run away if you make quick movements. Small conversation is usually rather impersonal and can consist of: the homework, weather, teachers, something on the news, or otherwise. If he really likes you, he won't be able to stop thinking about you.If you don't go to school with him, maybe ask what he likes to do other then homework, and school, or even maybe ask for his number. Remember if he doesn't text you first don't sweat it. If he's shy in person with you, he'll be shy everywhere with you!;, It won't intimidate him as much, and will give him a chance to think about his answer. If you don't have social media, just try asking for a simple number.  By talking to him a few times a week, you will begin establishing a bond and he may start to tear down his wall for you. After small talk, you should begin moving onto personal things like: family, travel, summer vacation plans, his hobbies, and other casual but personal topics.  After you've talked to him for awhile, transition conversations onto a more personal level. Perhaps talk about what you both are looking for in a person, and drop hints that what you're looking for is him.  Don't ask him if he's okay with being touched, just do it once and see how he reacts. A touch or pat on the shoulder is fine. If he seems to dislike it, then refrain from touching him until you know he is more comfortable with you. However, if he seems fine with it, then you should continue to do it every once in a while. Don't go too far; hugs (when needed), small touches on his arm, and pats on the shoulder are just fine.  Make sure to do this in private and one-on-one. Don't even ask around close friends, or else he might feel uncomfortable as well as feel pressured to say yes. You want him to say yes because he wants to, not because he thinks he needs to. He might also be pressured to say no, so be careful.  Going out to public places is most likely not his thing. Suggest a movie at your house (though he might be afraid to meet your parents) or something else that's away from people. You could also suggest getting drive-through dinner and parking some place quiet to eat and talk.  If necessary, find a way to increase his self-esteem. Make him feel confident around you.  It could be a homework problem or where to buy the latest gadget. Whatever works.  Because shy guys are guys too! Find out his hobbies or passions. Or talk about a common interest. DO NOT PRETEND TO LIKE SOMETHING YOU DON'T! But ask open-ended questions about it. It will make you a good listener, get to know him better, and you will have fewer chances to say something stupid. (If you do anyway, as 99% of us do, forgive yourself.), Most guys actually approach cute girls over gorgeous girls because they find really pretty girls out of their league. This applies particularly to shy guys, who have little confidence to begin with. I'm not saying it isn't okay to be really, really, really, incredibly good-looking.

Act like someone he would be interested in having a relationship with.Be a good listener, make interesting conversation, be funny, likable, and flirt - but don't overdo it.As you talk to him, create inside jokes between the two of you. If you can, compliment him! You'll probably get one back!Be unique, cute, and overall a fun person to be around.  Try to be friends with different people and befriend some of his friends - both male and female. With these friendships, don't make them just because of the guy. Make these friendships because you want to create new friendships with other people in addition to connecting more to your crush. You may be surprised at who you meet! If you make friends who are friends with him, you can have a good time and may be invited to the same events as him, parties, and other activities in which you can spend time with your guy. You can then have more excuses to talk to him and make transitioning into conversations with him easier.You can talk to one of his friends and if you're lucky, he might just walk in and start talking to the both of you.His friends will probably hint to you if he has taken a liking to you.It is very important to be real with this. Don't use people; it's a total turnoff. Create new and genuine friendships with his friends. Don't pretend to be friends with one of them just so you can talk to your crush. If you don't like his friends, you can choose to skip this step.  A strong friendship and a relationship doesn't come easily or quickly. You have to continue to create a better friendship which may or may not lead to something more. Having a relationship may take awhile but it may vary. It is important to be patient and don't be pushy. Don't make him uncomfortable.  By this point, it's either time to admit your feelings or get over him. If you feel like you've been waiting too long for him to ask you out, just admit you like him directly to his face. If you're feeling he's not the one anymore, try to move on.Remember that it can take a while for him to ask you out. Admitting you like him to your crush can speed up the process though.  You could just be really good friends with him or trying to handle rejection. Whatever it is, be happy because it is what is meant to be. If you're with him, congratulations!

You might have to try self restrictions by telling yourself that you are not going talk to the guys until you get your work done or unless you are on top of things in school.

"Don't stop talking to him about ""everyday"" things. Try not to fixate on the situation all the time. Don't stress out about who he's talking to. Remember that he, too, is probably nervous.",How to Deal With Your Crush when He Knows You Like Him1,"When you find out that your crush knows you like him, don't let this turn your relationship into something awkward and unpleasant. Try to continue talking about the things you normally would. For example, if you have classes together at school, don't hesitate to talk to him about your assignments. Keeping a casual attitude will make your interactions much easier.Keep in mind that he probably doesn't know that you know about him. If you keep your cool, you can buy a little extra time for yourself to come to grips with the situation. , When you're worried about how your crush knows you like him, constantly thinking about the situation is one of the worst things you can do. Try to keep your mind off of him by staying busy with your day-to-day activities. You can even avoid him for a day or two if it gives you time to calm down, although you won't want to do this for too long if you eventually plan on making a move.It can help if you don't think of the situation as a ""problem."" It's not necessarily a bad thing that he knows you like him. After all, would you be angry or upset if you knew someone liked you? Probably not.  Having a crush on someone can make even the most rational, level-headed people jealous.

Unless he's really immature, he probably wouldn't even consider doing that.  Your crush is just a normal, everyday human being like you. Many of the same things that make you nervous probably make you nervous. Since he knows you like him, he probably gets a few butterflies in his stomach when he talks to you.

Consider the positive qualities of each guy. Consider how each guy makes you feel. Consider the negative qualities of the guy. Consider how each guy feels about you. Ask your trusted friends for their opinions. Weigh their similarities and differences in a list. Trust your gut. Don't rush it. Commit to the guy you've chosen. Be prepared for the aftermath. Accept your decision.,How to Choose Between Two Guys,"The next time you're around each guy, make an effort to really engage him and to think about what it is you like about him so much. Though you can't always pin down the complicated feelings that make you like a person, it's important to have as much information as possible when you make such an important decision. Ask yourself the following questions when you talk to each guy:Does he make me laugh? Does he have a good sense of humor? We're all attracted to people who can make us laugh. Guys with a good sense of humor make us excited and cause us to look at the world in a different way. If he tickles you, is it weird or do you like it? No guy should touch you in the obvious places unless you are ready for that, but like a hug around the waist, holding hands, or even his arm around you is okay, but if you're at the stage where he is going to kiss you and you kiss him back, make sure that you are ready to be at that stage. When he kisses you, be sure you know how to kiss. You don't want it to be awkward. The guy you are going to choose needs to be able to restrain himself.Does he seem curious about other people? Is he interested in things outside himself? Guys who are only interested in themselves can be pretty boring. You'll want a guy who has hobbies, friends, and a good perspective on life.Is he in touch with his emotional side? Is he sensitive about other people? Lots of guys have an emotional side; the problem is they don't want other people to see it. A guy who's okay with other people seeing his emotions is a guy who's both confident and mature.Does he flirt respectfully? Basically, the ask question boils down to this: Does it seem like he likes you for more than just your body or just your looks? Are the compliments he gives you more than just about your body?Does he take things slow? Guys who take things slow like to savor things. They care about getting every last drop of enjoyment out of being around you. Guys who are moving at the speed of light are often onto the next girl faster than you can say ""letdown."";, This is just as important as thinking about what you like about each guy. One guy may look better on paper and may have all of the qualities that you're looking for, but the other guy may have the ability to make your heart pound just by sending you a text message. So, the next time you're around each guy, think not only about why you like him, but ask yourself if he makes you feel confident, happy, giddy, and like a better person. Here are some things to consider:How does he make you feel when you're around him? Does he make you feel like he's only interested in you, or does he seem like he flirts with other girls all the time, and you're just another girl on his long list?Does he bring out the best in you, or is he okay with you just being ""okay""?Does he challenge you and make you want to be a better person?Does he compliment you in a way that is meaningful and not forced?Does he make you blush, giggle, and feel like a giddy little girl?Does he treat you like a lady and make you feel special?, Though you may only be thinking about all of the great qualities of both guys and about how they both give you butterflies, you should also consider the negative aspects of their personality or lifestyle to get more clarification. If you're serious about making this choice, then you have to consider the pros and the cons of being with each guy. Here are some things to consider as you make your decision:Does the guy have a lot of baggage? Does he have a complicated past and a slew of emotional issues to deal with? Sure, you may have fun with him, but is that something you want to be responsible for in the long run?Is he bossy and manipulative? Does he always try to get his way, or is he incapable of admitting he's wrong? These are serious signs that he's probably a little selfish, and signs that you might get more than you bargained for in a relationship.Has he lied to you? You want a guy that you can trust, a guy who's not afraid to be honest with you, regardless of how much the truth hurts. Guys who like gossiping and starting rumors probably don't care much about other people, meaning stay away from him.Does he constantly get in trouble, either at school, with his parents, or with the authorities? Bad boys may have a certain sexiness about them, but chances are if they're constantly distracted with shenanigans or hijinks, they won't have any time to be around you.Does he still talk about his ex-girlfriend? If he's still talking about his ex, dropping in little hints from time to time, or constantly talking about her, that's a bad sign. It doesn't mean that he's a bad guy; it just means that he still loves her.  If both guys are completely devoted to you, then you have a tough task on your hands. Though you shouldn't go with the guy who likes you more just because it's a safer choice, you should consider how important you are to each guy, and what it would mean to him if you stopped seeing him. If he would just shrug it off and then move on to the next girl, then he's not the guy for you. If you think one of the guys likes you much more than the other, then this should play a strong part in your decision.You don't have to ask outright. You can get a sense of how much guy feels about you just by the way he looks at you, by how often he wants to hang out, and by how much he talks about a future together.Of course, if you're just looking to have fun with a summer fling or to get some dating experience for a few months, then you don't have to care so much about whether the guy sees you as long term potential.  Your friends are there for a reason: they offer shoulders to lean on, provide examples of how to behave, and give you advice when you need it. Take their advice, but with a grain of salt. You're making the decision at the end of the day. Remember that you're not asking them to help you pick the ""better"" guy, or the guy that they would pick, but that you want them to help you decide what's right for you.Don't ask, ""Who do you like better?"" Ask, ""Who do you think is better for me?"" These questions will keep you from getting suggestions about who your friends would date, instead of who you should date.Be open to their suggestions! If you have your mind made up about who you want to date, there's no use in asking your friends about their opinion. If you ask them for their input, be ready to follow it.  This will help you see what you really wanted in the first place. How does each one make you feel? Make a list of what you really want in a guy and don't. Do a pro/cons chart about each guy's strengths and weaknesses. See how this pro/cons chart lines up with the list of what you want out of a guy. Here are some other questions you can ask:Which guy will treat me better?Which guy will be there for me through the tough times?Which guy do I have more in common with?Which guy's face will I always want to see at the end of the day?Which guy will get along better with my friends and family?Which guy can I not live without?, We can't pick and choose who we like. We're born a certain way, and we eventually develop likes and dislikes. Don't overthink things. Trust what your gut tells you about these guys and go for it. Flip a coin in the air. Tell yourself that if it lands on heads, you have to go with Guy A, and if it lands on tails, you have to go with Guy B. While the coin is in the air, where do you instinctively want it to land? That's your answer.If you know one guy is bad for you but can't help feeling attracted to him (and don't really like the other guy), take a break from both guys. Not being in a relationship really isn't bad. In fact, it's much better than being burned.Learn from your mistakes. If you've dated a certain guy before and the relationship ended poorly, don't make the same mistake all over again with another guy. Even if you feel attracted to him, what's the use in going through the same thing all over again if it caused you heartbreak and misery?, Don't feel like you need to make a decision right away. Your decision could take some time. During that time, hopefully, one of the guys will do something good or bad to make the decision much easier for you. As long as you haven't committed to either guy and don't feel like you're being disloyal to one guy by hanging out with the other, then you should take some time to make the decision.Just don't drag it on too long. If you pick one guy, but he finds out that you've been hanging out with another guy for the last few months, then he may feel hurt or slighted.  Once you've made your decision, stick to it. That doesn't mean you have to tell the guy, ""Hey, I chose you over Guy A!"" That won't make the guy feel very special. The commitment is something you make through your actions and your heart. Work on building a healthy, stable relationship with the guy you've chosen -- and only the guy you've chosen.Get ready to start dating and hanging out with only the guy you've chosen. Enjoy the benefits of being with one person without wondering what another guy is up to.If you feel empty or incomplete without the other guy, then it may either mean that you made the wrong decision or that you never liked the first guy that much in the first place -- you only liked the chase.Be friendly to the other guy, but don't go out of your way to hang out with him or do stuff alone together. If you're overly friendly with him, he might think that he still has a chance. Plus, it might get the guy you chose unnecessarily jealous.  Know that choosing between two guys will affect your relationship with both of them. This is the double-edged sword of relationships: chances are good that you're going to break the other guy's heart, and miss out on a relationship with him. If the guy you don't choose doesn't know about the first guy, you don't have to make it a big deal or give him the real reason why you're ending your ""relationship."" Though you should be happy once you've made your decision, know that the seas may still be a bit rocky.Know that you may turn guys against each other. What if both guys are best friends? What do you do then? If you choose one and the other likes you, they'll probably stop being best friends. If you want to avoid this situation altogether, date someone else instead.Be prepared to lose the guy that you didn't choose. He may not want to be ""just friends"" after you hung out romantically or flirted with each other. But that may be for the best.  Life is yours to live, and you deserve to live it the way you want -- while trying to hurt others as little as possible. Though you may feel guilty for making the decision, you and the two guys are better off once you've come to terms with your feelings. Be proud of yourself for making a mature choice instead of leading two guys on forever.Don't be afraid of making mistakes as long as you learn from them.Don't worry about having everyone like you; when you're making a big decision like this, feelings will get hurt.","[""The next time you're around each guy, make an effort to really engage him and to think about what it is you like about him so much."", ""Though you can't always pin down the complicated feelings that make you like a person, it's important to have as much information as possible when you make such an important decision."", 'Ask yourself the following questions when you talk to each guy:Does he make me laugh?', 'Does he have a good sense of humor?', ""We're all attracted to people who can make us laugh."", 'Guys with a good sense of humor make us excited and cause us to look at the world in a different way.', 'If he tickles you, is it weird or do you like it?', ""No guy should touch you in the obvious places unless you are ready for that, but like a hug around the waist, holding hands, or even his arm around you is okay, but if you're at the stage where he is going to kiss you and you kiss him back, make sure that you are ready to be at that stage."", 'When he kisses you, be sure you know how to kiss.', ""You don't want it to be awkward."", 'The guy you are going to choose needs to be able to restrain himself.', 'Does he seem curious about other people?', 'Is he interested in things outside himself?', 'Guys who are only interested in themselves can be pretty boring.', ""You'll want a guy who has hobbies, friends, and a good perspective on life."", 'Is he in touch with his emotional side?', 'Is he sensitive about other people?', ""Lots of guys have an emotional side;

This way you can pretend that you aren't trying to talk to him because you like him, but just because you're just bored and have nothing to do but to talk to him or you can pretend that you're just being friendly.  If you have trouble with math and he's a math whiz, ask him to help you with the math. If you're carrying something heavy, then ask him to help you carry it.

"Decide whether you will admit your crush. If you want to come clean to your crush, don't put it off. Keep things casual. Don't be put off by his shyness. Accept his decision (even if it's ""no"").",How to Deal With Your Crush when He Knows You Like Him2,"Sooner or later, you need to commit to either talking to your crush about the way you feel or staying silent. Being undecided about a crush is a terrible feeling. Making a decision can be scary, but it gives you closure. You get to either take things to the next level with your crush or start moving on, but either way you don't have to worry about it anymore.Often, honesty is the best policy. Being open about your crush can feel like taking a huge weight off your chest — no matter what happens, you were true to your heart. It also lets you avoid nagging feelings of regret. In other words, you won't be wondering, ""What would have happened if I had talked to my crush?"" in a few weeks. Try explaining to him that you don't want to ruin the friendship and you wouldn't like it to be awkward. Usually he would accept that and try to keep things as normal as they were before whilst deciding his next move.On the other hand, if you really don't want to open up about your crush or you have good reason to think it's a bad idea, you shouldn't ever feel like you need to. An example of a situation where it would be a bad idea to act on a crush is if your crush is already with someone else.  If you decide that you're going to open up to your crush, don't waste time waiting for the ""perfect moment."" It probably will never come. In the meantime, your crush may lose interest or even start to think that you don't like him anymore. Pick a time and place where you can be alone with your crush and stick to this. Your best chances for romance will come if you seize the opportunities you are given.For example, if your crush is someone you know from school, you might arrange to meet this person after school in a secluded spot. It doesn't have to be 100% deserted — just reasonably private. A park bench, for instance, will usually work fine.  Opening up to your crush doesn't have to be a huge, dramatic production. In fact, if you make a big deal about it, you may even scare your crush off. Instead, keep the conversation low-pressure and casual. This will make it much easier for him to give you an honest answer.You don't even have to outright say that you have a crush. Instead, you can simply invite him to spend one-on-one time together. For example, you might start the conversation by saying something like, ""Hey, Spanish class has been fun. Do you want to get some lunch and go to the fair with me this weekend? I hear the enchiladas they have out there are amazing."", Even if you keep things very low-pressure, your crush might get a little shy. Don't worry about this. Don't take silence or awkwardness as a sign that he doesn't like you. These things just show that he is having a hard time getting his words out. Give him plenty of time to take in what you're saying and encourage him to come to a conclusion when he's ready.He shouldn't even feel like he needs to answer you right away. Getting a date offer or having someone admit they like you can take a day or two to fully process. Consider saying something like, ""Take your time — you don't have to tell me today."", Respect your crush's ability to come to his own decisions, even if you don't like the one he makes. If he says no, just casually say, ""Oh, OK"" and make your exit. Don't pester him with repeated questions or try to get him to change his mind. On the other hand, if he does accept your offer, congratulations!After a ""no,"" you may want to limit the amount of time you spend with this person for a couple days. You don't have to outright ignore him, but if your feelings are hurt or if it's hard to stop thinking about it, give yourself some distance for a little while until your emotions die down.","['Sooner or later, you need to commit to either talking to your crush about the way you feel or staying silent.', 'Being undecided about a crush is a terrible feeling.', 'Making a decision can be scary, but it gives you closure.', ""You get to either take things to the next level with your crush or start moving on, but either way you don't have to worry about it anymore."", 'Often, honesty is the best policy.', 'Being open about your crush can feel like taking a huge weight off your chest — no matter what happens, you were true to your heart.', 'It also lets you avoid nagging feelings of regret.', 'In other words, you won\'t be wondering, ""What would have happened if I had talked to my crush?""', 'in a few weeks.', ""Try explaining to him that you don't want to ruin the friendship and you wouldn't like it to be awkward."", 'Usually he would accept that and try to keep things as normal as they were before whilst deciding his next move.', ""On the other hand, if you really don't want to open up about your crush or you have good reason to think it's a bad idea, you shouldn't ever feel like you need to."", 'An example of a situation where it would be a bad idea to act on a crush is if your crush is already with someone else.', 'If you decide that you\'re going to open up to your crush, don\'t waste time waiting for the ""perfect moment.""', 'It probably will never come.', ""In the meantime, your crush may lose interest or even start to think that you don't like him anymore."", 'Pick a time and place where you can be alone with your crush and stick to this.', 'Your best chances for romance will come if you seize the opportunities you are given.', 'For example, if your crush is someone you know from school, you might arrange to meet this person after school in a secluded spot.', ""It doesn't have to be 100% deserted — just reasonably private."", 'A park bench, for instance, will usually work fine.', ""Opening up to your crush doesn't have to be a huge, dramatic production."", 'In fact, if you make a big deal about it, you may even scare your crush off.', 'Instead, keep the conversation low-pressure and casual.', 'This will make it much easier for him to give you an honest answer.', ""You don't even have to outright say that you have a crush."", 'Instead, you can simply invite him to spend one-on-one time together.', 'For example, you might start the conversation by saying something like, ""Hey, Spanish class has been fun.', 'Do you want to get some lunch and go to the fair with me this weekend?', 'I hear the enchiladas they have out there are amazing."", Even if you keep things very low-pressure, your crush might get a little shy.', ""Don't worry about this."", ""Don't take silence or awkwardness as a sign that he doesn't like you."", 'These things just show that he is having a hard time getting his words out.', ""Give him plenty of time to take in what you're saying and encourage him to come to a conclusion when he's ready."", ""He shouldn't even feel like he needs to answer you right away."", 'Getting a date offer or having someone admit they like you can take a day or two to fully process.', 'Consider saying something like, ""Take your time — you don\'t have to tell me today.', '"", Respect your crush\'s ability to come to his own decisions, even if you don\'t like the one he makes.', 'If he says no, just casually say, ""Oh, OK"" and make your exit.', ""Don't pester him with repeated questions or try to get him to change his mind."", 'On the other hand, if he does accept your offer, congratulations!After a ""no,"" you may want to limit the amount of time you spend with this person for a couple days.', ""You don't have to outright ignore him, but if your feelings are hurt or if it's hard to stop thinking about it, give yourself some distance for a little while until your emotions die down.""]"

"Be positive, but do not fake it. Look nice. Take care of your hair. Talk to his friends. Make him laugh. Don't be creepy. Don't act fake. Be cute. Be confident. Don't over think it... just be yourself. Know your values and stick to them.",How to Catch a Guy's Attention,"Smile and be happy. Don't be a downer all the time. Get plenty of sleep and exercise. Otherwise, he'll think you're always upset and he doesn't want someone to bring him down. He wants someone to bring him up. However, if you're feeling down one day, don't feel like you have to fake happiness. Otherwise you'll seem fake. , Make sure your clothes fit properly and you're in your comfort zone when it comes to showing skin. You don't want him to think you're high maintenance. Brush your teeth. Spray some perfume on yourself, but not too much, as you don't want your scent to be over-bearing. Just enough to where you pass him his face turns towards you. That's one trick to catch his attention. The most important thing in looking nice is that you like the way you look. Usually we are our own worst critics; if you even slightly like your appearance, you probably look great!, Your hair doesn't always have to be down. If it's knotty and gross looking, then throw it up with your bangs down. Straighten your hair when the weather is nice out, or scrunch it when it's rainy or a bit humid. Experiment with what looks best with your hair; again, remember you are your own worst critic.  When you're around his friends, talk to them, especially if he's around. If he sees you talking to his friends he might come over and join in the conversation. That's when you talk to him and find out about him. If he doesn't seem interested in whatever you are talking about, then bring up a new topic.  Crack a joke or two. Even if you know they're not funny if he laughs that's a sign that he's into you. Try not to be too serious; guys of any age sometimes tease girls they like.  Don't find out where he works and go there everyday. He'll think you're creepy and that you're stalking him. Guys don't like that, and if he thinks you're creepy, your chances just went down the drain. Don't find out where every one of his classes are and follow him there. Don't stand at his locker; if your locker is near his, then that's a different story. If he asks then you simply say ""my locker is right here"".  This is the most important step in catching his attention. Don't have your shirt down to your navel if you feel terrible wearing it just to get attention or a really long shirt if you feel awful in them. He'll mistake you for being insecure and think you are miserable and desperate, which you aren't! Don't lie about how many guys you've been with, and don't wear something completely impractical like super shorts in the middle of Winter, he'll consider you outlandish.  Smile and flirt, but not too much. Don't over think how you talk to him; otherwise you might seem fake.  Give yourself a mental pep-talk before you talk to him. Don't worry about how you look or anything. Remember that he is just a person, and nothing to freak out about; be yourself, and if it happens, it happens.

"Breathe!,Concentrate on him. Calm yourself with music.If you have music handy and it seems natural to play it, great!,Make an “okay” sign with your fingers. Move your feet.",How to Calm Your Nerves Around the Guy You Like1,"When you feel your heart thudding faster and faster, pay attention to how you are breathing. Remember: the quicker you breathe, the less air your lungs get. That means your heart is speeding up to pump the little oxygen you have to the rest of your body. So make a point of taking deep breaths to calm your body and mind.Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.Imagine that your lungs are down in your abs.Think about filling your abs with air instead of your chest. This will help you draw longer breaths. , Keep your focus on what is happening outside of you, rather than inside. Focus all of your attention entirely on him. Empty your mind of everything else. Ignore your own internal reactions, worries, and concerns. Just pay attention to what he says and does and react to that.Obviously, you’re a human being hoping to have a conversation here, so you can’t really empty your mind of everything. The goal is to quiet any thoughts that don’t have anything to do with the immediate conversation. Just think about what you’re going to say in response to what he says, not how you feel inside. For example:If he asks for your opinion on something (like your taste in music), speak from the gut and tell the truth, regardless of what his opinion may be. Keep the conversation going instead of stalling it by trying to second-guess yourself about what he will think of your answer.If he says something you disagree with, say so. Don't start yourself worrying about how he might react. It's better to deal with his reaction, whatever it may be, than worry over a hundred different scenarios that probably won't happen anyway.  Play something relaxing and keep an ear tuned to that. If not, just play a song that usually calms you down in the back of your head.The key is to play something calming. Your breathing, heart rate, and other body rhythms will naturally fall in sync with the music’s rhythm.This is also a great ice breaker to get the conversation rolling and find out his interests.Depending on where you are, subtle ways to go about this could be fiddling with a car radio, switching between music channels on TV, starting your iPod or other device before you engage him, or asking him if he wants to check out that jukebox in the corner.  With one hand, form an “O” by bringing the tip of your index finger and the tip of your thumb together. Leave your other three fingers straight, but relaxed. Sounds weird, but this is actually a yoga trick known as the Gyan Mudra. Instead of focusing on all the thoughts and feelings building up inside you, just concentrate on keeping the tips of your thumb and index together together.If you think this will look weird, just hold your hands behind your back, or use whatever you’re holding (like a textbook) to hide it from view.  Release your stress by moving around. Get your blood flowing and get rid of the tension building up inside you. Full-out dancing is a proven way to lower your anxiety, but even though it would probably be too weird if you broke out into a jig for no reason, moving around just a little bit will still help.A simple solution is to just get the conversation mobile by suggesting a walk-and-talk!If you're already playing music, let yourself move to the rhythm.Slowly stepping off and on a curb or stair step also be a way to burn off nervous energy without looking too odd.","['When you feel your heart thudding faster and faster, pay attention to how you are breathing.', 'Remember: the quicker you breathe, the less air your lungs get.', 'That means your heart is speeding up to pump the little oxygen you have to the rest of your body.', 'So make a point of taking deep breaths to calm your body and mind.', 'Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.', 'Imagine that your lungs are down in your abs.', 'Think about filling your abs with air instead of your chest.', 'This will help you draw longer breaths.', ', Keep your focus on what is happening outside of you, rather than inside.', 'Focus all of your attention entirely on him.', 'Empty your mind of everything else.', 'Ignore your own internal reactions, worries, and concerns.', 'Just pay attention to what he says and does and react to that.', 'Obviously, you’re a human being hoping to have a conversation here, so you can’t really empty your mind of everything.', 'The goal is to quiet any thoughts that don’t have anything to do with the immediate conversation.', 'Just think about what you’re going to say in response to what he says, not how you feel inside.', 'For example:If he asks for your opinion on something (like your taste in music), speak from the gut and tell the truth, regardless of what his opinion may be.', 'Keep the conversation going instead of stalling it by trying to second-guess yourself about what he will think of your answer.', 'If he says something you disagree with, say so.', ""Don't start yourself worrying about how he might react."", ""It's better to deal with his reaction, whatever it may be, than worry over a hundred different scenarios that probably won't happen anyway."", 'Play something relaxing and keep an ear tuned to that.', 'If not, just play a song that usually calms you down in the back of your head.', 'The key is to play something calming.', 'Your breathing, heart rate, and other body rhythms will naturally fall in sync with the music’s rhythm.', 'This is also a great ice breaker to get the conversation rolling and find out his interests.', 'Depending on where you are, subtle ways to go about this could be fiddling with a car radio, switching between music channels on TV, starting your iPod or other device before you engage him, or asking him if he wants to check out that jukebox in the corner.', 'With one hand, form an “O” by bringing the tip of your index finger and the tip of your thumb together.', 'Leave your other three fingers straight, but relaxed.', 'Sounds weird, but this is actually a yoga trick known as the Gyan Mudra.', 'Instead of focusing on all the thoughts and feelings building up inside you, just concentrate on keeping the tips of your thumb and index together together.', 'If you think this will look weird, just hold your hands behind your back, or use whatever you’re holding (like a textbook) to hide it from view.', 'Release your stress by moving around.', 'Get your blood flowing and get rid of the tension building up inside you.', 'Full-out dancing is a proven way to lower your anxiety, but even though it would probably be too weird if you broke out into a jig for no reason, moving around just a little bit will still help.', ""A simple solution is to just get the conversation mobile by suggesting a walk-and-talk!If you're already playing music, let yourself move to the rhythm."", 'Slowly stepping off and on a curb or stair step also be a way to burn off nervous energy without looking too odd.']"
Just go for it. Open with something casual. Look at him. Make him talk about himself at first. Offer your own insights. Keep the tone light.,How to Calm Your Nerves Around the Guy You Like2,"When you see him, walk right up and start a conversation.Spark his interest by showing him yours! Demonstrate how confident you are by seeking him out right away, rather than forever waiting for that ""perfect moment"" that may or may not come.Don’t worry about declaring your undying love right away. Simply get the ball rolling by showing him that you would like to get to know him better.Don’t feel super-confident just yet? That is all the more reason to go straight up to him! Dawdling will just give you more time to overthink things and stress yourself out.Also, you don't want to give someone else a chance to get in there first and hog his attention.  Don’t stress yourself about flooring him with the most clever thing that you could possibly say. Instead, start small and build from there. Draw him into a conversation with you by posing an offhand question or asking for a quick favor.Whichever you choose, be sure the topic is something that will lead to an actual back-and-forth conversation, instead of a one-word answer. Open with something like:“Is that the new iPhone? Could I take a peek at it? I need to replace my phone and I’m not sure what I want to get.”“You have Ms. Novak for first period, right? What was her test like? I have to take it eighth period.”“I like your Smiths t-shirt. Real quick: what’s your favorite album and why?”, When you approach, make direct eye contact and maintain it. Even though you’re nervous, stop yourself from glancing away to stare at your feet or something in the distance. Gain his attention and keep it by keeping yours on him from start to finish!Smile, too! Put him at ease with a grin as you approach. Remember: you want him to like talking with you, so show him that this conversation is going to be a good thing by opening with a big friendly smile.  Once you draw him into a conversation, keep him engaged by sticking to a subject he knows about: himself! As you move from topic to topic, show him that your main interest isn’t the topic itself, but what he thinks about it. Flatter his ego so he feels eager to share. At the same time, avoid the stress of being in the spotlight by keeping it trained on him!Think of yourself as an interviewer. Ask lots of questions. For example, if he happens to have a book with him:Ask him what he thinks of it so far.Then ask what other authors he enjoys.Quiz him with: “Which five books would you bring if you were stranded on a desert island?”Then ask if he could only recommend one to read, which one would it be.  Don’t overdo the questioning and make him feel like this is an interrogation! Start peppering the conversation with your own opinions and anecdotes. Even though you feel nervous at first, share a small piece of yourself when he shares something with you. As you grow more comfortable, expand and offer him a wider view so the conversation grows to be equal parts give and take.For instance, if one of the books he picks to bring with him to a desert island is the same as one of your picks, say so!Then use that topic to direct more questions at him: “Which character do you most identify with? What was your favorite part? What did you think of the movie?”When he shares his answer with you, return the favor by answering your own question.By asking lots of questions and sharing your own answers, you can control the course of the conversation and share exactly what you want to share.  As the conversation builds, stick to topics that the both of you enjoy. Even though you may want this guy to be your shoulder to cry on when you need one, save that for later. For now, show him that you are fun to be around by keeping the conversation carefree.If he brings up a topic that stresses you out, redirect the focus to something more positive.Let’s say he brings up a flood that recently hit the city where your favorite aunt lives.Instead of focusing on the flood, use that as a segue to talk to about a happy memory of your aunt or that city.From there, shift the focus back onto him by asking about his favorite family member or city.","['When you see him, walk right up and start a conversation.', 'Spark his interest by showing him yours!', 'Demonstrate how confident you are by seeking him out right away, rather than forever waiting for that ""perfect moment"" that may or may not come.', 'Don’t worry about declaring your undying love right away.', 'Simply get the ball rolling by showing him that you would like to get to know him better.', 'Don’t feel super-confident just yet?', 'That is all the more reason to go straight up to him!', 'Dawdling will just give you more time to overthink things and stress yourself out.', ""Also, you don't want to give someone else a chance to get in there first and hog his attention."", 'Don’t stress yourself about flooring him with the most clever thing that you could possibly say.', 'Instead, start small and build from there.', 'Draw him into a conversation with you by posing an offhand question or asking for a quick favor.', 'Whichever you choose, be sure the topic is something that will lead to an actual back-and-forth conversation, instead of a one-word answer.', 'Open with something like:“Is that the new iPhone?', 'Could I take a peek at it?', 'I need to replace my phone and I’m not sure what I want to get.”“You', 'have Ms. Novak for first period, right?', 'What was her test like?', 'I have to take it eighth period.', '”“I', 'like your Smiths t-shirt.', 'Real quick: what’s your favorite album and why?”', ', When you approach, make direct eye contact and maintain it.', 'Even though you’re nervous, stop yourself from glancing away to stare at your feet or something in the distance.', 'Gain his attention and keep it by keeping yours on him from start to finish!Smile, too!', 'Put him at ease with a grin as you approach.', 'Remember: you want him to like talking with you, so show him that this conversation is going to be a good thing by opening with a big friendly smile.', 'Once you draw him into a conversation, keep him engaged by sticking to a subject he knows about: himself!', 'As you move from topic to topic, show him that your main interest isn’t the topic itself, but what he thinks about it.', 'Flatter his ego so he feels eager to share.', 'At the same time, avoid the stress of being in the spotlight by keeping it trained on him!Think of yourself as an interviewer.', 'Ask lots of questions.', 'For example, if he happens to have a book with him:Ask him what he thinks of it so far.', 'Then ask what other authors he enjoys.', 'Quiz him with: “Which five books would you bring if you were stranded on a desert island?”Then ask if he could only recommend one to read, which one would it be.', 'Don’t overdo the questioning and make him feel like this is an interrogation!', 'Start peppering the conversation with your own opinions and anecdotes.', 'Even though you feel nervous at first, share a small piece of yourself when he shares something with you.', 'As you grow more comfortable, expand and offer him a wider view so the conversation grows to be equal parts give and take.', 'For instance, if one of the books he picks to bring with him to a desert island is the same as one of your picks, say so!Then use that topic to direct more questions at him: “Which character do you most identify with?', 'What was your favorite part?', 'What did you think of the movie?”When he shares his answer with you, return the favor by answering your own question.', 'By asking lots of questions and sharing your own answers, you can control the course of the conversation and share exactly what you want to share.', 'As the conversation builds, stick to topics that the both of you enjoy.', 'Even though you may want this guy to be your shoulder to cry on when you need one, save that for later.', 'For now, show him that you are fun to be around by keeping the conversation carefree.', 'If he brings up a topic that stresses you out, redirect the focus to something more positive.', 'Let’s say he brings up a flood that recently hit the city where your favorite aunt lives.', 'Instead of focusing on the flood, use that as a segue to talk to about a happy memory of your aunt or that city.', 'From there, shift the focus back onto him by asking about his favorite family member or city.']"
"Be confident in your looks. Think positively. Keep your mind open to all possibilities. Stay open-minded afterward, too.",How to Calm Your Nerves Around the Guy You Like3,"Don’t fret about what he might think of your appearance. Be comfortable in your body, even if his previous girlfriends belong to a totally different “type.” Rest assured that guys respond more to your self-confidence than your looks. So instead of stressing out about mirroring his type, fix yourself up however you like to. Then simply walk into every room like you own it by:Refraining from slouching or sticking your hands in your pockets.Keeping your chin up with your neck extended.Throwing your shoulders back.Allowing your arms to swing freely.  Give each interaction the chance to develop into something great. Don’t shoot yourself in the foot by assuming that everything will go wrong!When you’re with him, avoid over-analyzing the situation. Just take pleasure in interacting with him by staying in the moment, rather than dwelling on the past or trying to predict the future. Respond to what he (and anyone else in your group) says or does right here, right now, and nothing more.Keep your mind clear of any preconceived notions about what he might mean with this comment or that look.Focus on what goes right: a joke that he finds funny; his willingness to share his opinions and personal experiences; his interest in your own opinions and stories.Let the not-so-right parts slide. Recover quickly by refusing to dwell on them! For instance, if your joke falls flat, simply make a joke out of that by making cricket noises and then laughing it off.  Remember: you don’t know everything! So if you feel like he isn’t interested in being with you or even just chatting right now, don’t take that as a personal slight. Take a step back and think of every reason that might be, rather than just assume that he doesn’t like you. Other possibilities could be:He’s shy in general or (gasp!) nervous because he’s attracted to you, too!He may be distracted by something else in his life, like schoolwork, his job, or a family situation.He may just have little to say about the particular topic you bring up.

"Be yourself. Look your best, but don't obsess over your looks. Use confident body language. Think of him as an ordinary person (not an idol). Don't over-think things.",How to Be Confident Around Your Crush1,"If there's only one thing you do to boost your confidence, make it this. Try not to fall for the trap of changing your normal behavior to impress your crush. This is a bad idea for a few reasons. First, it puts pressure on you to be someone you're not, which can add to your stresses because it's not something you're used to. Second, it gives your crush a false idea of who you are. This can lead to confusion and hurt feelings when you drop the act. On the other hand, if you're true to yourself, you don't have to worry about keeping any lies straight.This basic idea can extend to things as simple as casual conversations. For example, if your crush says that they love the movie Fight Club and you haven't seen it, don't say ""Me too!"" to try to impress. This is setting yourself up for embarrassment if, for instance, your crush asks what your favorite part is. , In the grand scheme of things, looks are only a single, fairly shallow part of what makes someone attracted to someone else. However, putting a little extra effort into your looks can be very useful if it helps you keep your confidence high. Consider spending a little extra time each morning putting yourself together if you know your crush is going to be around. Loving the way that you look in the mirror will help you feel positive about yourself later in the day.However, you'll never want to spend too much time worrying about the way you look. Remember that your crush is most likely to like you for your personality, not the way you look. Stressing out about whether or not you look perfect will only lower your confidence and make it harder for you to act natural when you're around your crush.  The way you carry yourself can have a big effect on how confident you look — and feel. While sitting or walking, keep your shoulders back, your head slightly raised, and your chest slightly stuck out. Above all, wear a classy smile. People are generally much more likely to start conversation with people who appear friendly and open.On the other hand, ""nervous"" behaviors can make you look and feel less confident. Try to avoid fiddling with your hair, biting your nails, and similar gestures.  When you're absolutely infatuated with someone, it's easy to forget that they're an ordinary person. In addition to the things that make them amazing, crushes have flaws, fears, and insecurities just like you do. They are complex, imperfect people, so don't think of them like movie stars or royalty. Instead, try to think of them the same way you'd think of any casual acquaintance.This is especially important if you eventually start a relationship with this person. Sooner or later, if you spend enough time together, you will find things about each other that you don't like. This can be a very unpleasant realization if you have the idea that your significant other is perfect.  Scrutinizing every single action that you make around your crush (or that your crash makes around you) is a sure fire way to turn yourself into a nervous wreck. Odds are that you don't always choose the perfect thing to say or do when you're around your friends and family, so there's no reason to worry about this when you're with your crush. Ironically, stressing out about every single thing that happens just makes it more likely that you'll make a mistake, so stay cool!If, during a conversation, you find yourself thinking, ""Oh my gosh, why did I just say that?"", relax. Most minor mistakes will go completely unnoticed. If they don't, your crush may even find them amusing. Most people won't get offended or angry over a minor slip-up. Besides, if they do, they aren't good crush material.","[""If there's only one thing you do to boost your confidence, make it this."", 'Try not to fall for the trap of changing your normal behavior to impress your crush.', 'This is a bad idea for a few reasons.', ""First, it puts pressure on you to be someone you're not, which can add to your stresses because it's not something you're used to."", 'Second, it gives your crush a false idea of who you are.', 'This can lead to confusion and hurt feelings when you drop the act.', ""On the other hand, if you're true to yourself, you don't have to worry about keeping any lies straight."", 'This basic idea can extend to things as simple as casual conversations.', 'For example, if your crush says that they love the movie Fight Club and you haven\'t seen it, don\'t say ""Me too!"" to try to impress.', 'This is setting yourself up for embarrassment if, for instance, your crush asks what your favorite part is. ,', 'In the grand scheme of things, looks are only a single, fairly shallow part of what makes someone attracted to someone else.', 'However, putting a little extra effort into your looks can be very useful if it helps you keep your confidence high.', 'Consider spending a little extra time each morning putting yourself together if you know your crush is going to be around.', 'Loving the way that you look in the mirror will help you feel positive about yourself later in the day.', ""However, you'll never want to spend too much time worrying about the way you look."", 'Remember that your crush is most likely to like you for your personality, not the way you look.', ""Stressing out about whether or not you look perfect will only lower your confidence and make it harder for you to act natural when you're around your crush."", 'The way you carry yourself can have a big effect on how confident you look — and feel.', 'While sitting or walking, keep your shoulders back, your head slightly raised, and your chest slightly stuck out.', 'Above all, wear a classy smile.', 'People are generally much more likely to start conversation with people who appear friendly and open.', 'On the other hand, ""nervous"" behaviors can make you look and feel less confident.', 'Try to avoid fiddling with your hair, biting your nails, and similar gestures.', ""When you're absolutely infatuated with someone, it's easy to forget that they're an ordinary person."", 'In addition to the things that make them amazing, crushes have flaws, fears, and insecurities just like you do.', ""They are complex, imperfect people, so don't think of them like movie stars or royalty."", ""Instead, try to think of them the same way you'd think of any casual acquaintance."", 'This is especially important if you eventually start a relationship with this person.', ""Sooner or later, if you spend enough time together, you will find things about each other that you don't like."", 'This can be a very unpleasant realization if you have the idea that your significant other is perfect.', 'Scrutinizing every single action that you make around your crush (or that your crash makes around you) is a sure fire way to turn yourself into a nervous wreck.', ""Odds are that you don't always choose the perfect thing to say or do when you're around your friends and family, so there's no reason to worry about this when you're with your crush."", 'Ironically, stressing out about every single thing that happens just makes it more likely that you\'ll make a mistake, so stay cool!If, during a conversation, you find yourself thinking, ""Oh my gosh, why did I just say that?"", relax.', 'Most minor mistakes will go completely unnoticed.', ""If they don't, your crush may even find them amusing."", ""Most people won't get offended or angry over a minor slip-up."", ""Besides, if they do, they aren't good crush material.""]"
"Flirt a little to test the waters. Spend a little time with each other before you make any decisions. Be direct with your intentions, but keep things casual. Don't put too much weight in your crush's reply.",How to Be Confident Around Your Crush2,"Flirting is a great way to judge whether your crush is reciprocating your feelings. There are many different ways to flirt. For example, you can try gently teasing your crush about a mistake, as long as you keep things good-natured. You might also try delivering a suave compliment or making a subtle innuendo while you're talking with each other. Touch is also a good idea — try reaching out and touching your crush's shoulder when s/he says something that makes you laugh, for instance. If your crush goes along with your flirting or returns it, this is a good sign.See our flirting article for many more tips.  Crushes aren't always logical. If you're captivated by someone's looks and confidence, you may get a crush for this person before you have a good idea of who this person is. You don't want to make a move on someone only to find out later that you're not actually attracted to this person, so try to spend at least a little time together (alone or in groups) before you take the plunge.If you're nervous about spending casual time with your crush, pick activities that you know you're good at. Your natural confidence will make it easier to keep your cool while you're interacting. For example, if you're good at tennis, you might challenge your crush to a few friendly volleys.  No matter how confident you are, asking a crush out can cause some major butterflies. A good way to ""defuse"" the situation is to make your request a casual one. This takes some of the pressure off — your crush isn't deciding whether to express his or her undying love for you, just deciding whether to spend a little time together.You don't even have to bring up the idea of romance yet. For instance, you might simply ask your crush, ""Hey, do you want to go get some Mexican food after school?"" If you hit things off on your first hang-out session, then you can start hinting that you'd like to be more than friends.  Crushes aren't the end of the world. Try not to let yourself get too invested in the outcome of asking your crush out. For one, a ""no"" may have nothing to do with you — there may simply be other commitments that make romance impossible. More important, though, is the fact that one person's opinion of you doesn't matter. Crushes come and go, so don't let one determine how you feel about yourself.","['Flirting is a great way to judge whether your crush is reciprocating your feelings.', 'There are many different ways to flirt.', 'For example, you can try gently teasing your crush about a mistake, as long as you keep things good-natured.', ""You might also try delivering a suave compliment or making a subtle innuendo while you're talking with each other."", ""Touch is also a good idea — try reaching out and touching your crush's shoulder when s/he says something that makes you laugh, for instance."", 'If your crush goes along with your flirting or returns it, this is a good sign.', 'See our flirting article for many more tips.', ""Crushes aren't always logical."", ""If you're captivated by someone's looks and confidence, you may get a crush for this person before you have a good idea of who this person is."", ""You don't want to make a move on someone only to find out later that you're not actually attracted to this person, so try to spend at least a little time together (alone or in groups) before you take the plunge."", ""If you're nervous about spending casual time with your crush, pick activities that you know you're good at."", ""Your natural confidence will make it easier to keep your cool while you're interacting."", ""For example, if you're good at tennis, you might challenge your crush to a few friendly volleys."", 'No matter how confident you are, asking a crush out can cause some major butterflies.', 'A good way to ""defuse"" the situation is to make your request a casual one.', ""This takes some of the pressure off — your crush isn't deciding whether to express his or her undying love for you, just deciding whether to spend a little time together."", ""You don't even have to bring up the idea of romance yet."", 'For instance, you might simply ask your crush, ""Hey, do you want to go get some Mexican food after school?""', ""If you hit things off on your first hang-out session, then you can start hinting that you'd like to be more than friends."", ""Crushes aren't the end of the world."", 'Try not to let yourself get too invested in the outcome of asking your crush out.', 'For one, a ""no"" may have nothing to do with you — there may simply be other commitments that make romance impossible.', ""More important, though, is the fact that one person's opinion of you doesn't matter."", ""Crushes come and go, so don't let one determine how you feel about yourself.""]"

Be friendly. Find common ground. Get to know him better. Be playful.,How to Attract the Guy You Have a Crush On1,"If your crush has no idea you exist, it's going to be difficult to attract him. Try to get to know each other by becoming acquainted with his friends, joining a club he's in, or asking someone who knows him to introduce you. Be careful because if you don't want him to know you like him, they might say something which could ruin your chances and make things uncomfortable.If your crush is in your class, talk to him a little before or after class (talking during class could get you some unwanted, negative attention).You could comment on the teacher, the work you have to do or make a joke when he's listening. It's scary but you'll feel good once you make a move.Say something like, “The homework was hard last night. Were you able to figure it out?” to start a conversation with him. , It's easier to start conversations when you both have found something to talk about. You might possibly consider taking up some of his interests but don't become a whole different person just for someone else. It's definitely not worth it. If you have no common interests, don't freak out, just ask him about his hobbies or about something you already know he enjoys.For example, If you've never watched a TV show before that he's practically addicted to, just tell him, ask him about it to spark an instant conversation. You could say, “Have you ever seen ?” to get him talking about something he is a fan of and will get excited about.  You have to be friends before he will start to reciprocate the whole ""crush feeling"" in return. If you aren’t already friends, you could always start out by bringing up a general conversation topic (i.e. weather, a crazy thing that happened that day, presidential elections, assignments...) and if all else fails, you could always just ask for a pencil or some paper and go from there.Maybe after you've gotten to know him a little better, you can joke around or tease him, maybe even flirt with him - but don't get too ahead of yourself. He might feel awkward if a girl he barely knows starts flirting hard-core with him.Add him on Facebook or follow him on Twitter or Instagram if you haven’t already done so.

Most of the time, we see older people as more sophisticated and mature. This is most often the case, but not always. Some older boys will be just as immature as they ever were. , There's no point in dating an older boy because you think it will make you appear cooler. Before committing to a relationship, you should make sure you're ready for a relationship. Especially if you're looking to date someone older than you, there's that much less, If two people are at different stages in their lives, it can bring up issues in communication. For instance, if you want to go out and party with your older boyfriend, he might be at a part of his life where he's had his fun and prefers a night indoors. In some cases, it can be hard to have a sense of equality in a relationship when one person has considerably more life experience than the other. Keep these potential problems in mind before you commit.On the other hand, some maintain that age is just a number.There's no concrete reason why people of different ages can't connect on a deep, meaningful level.  Even if your relationship is perfect, other people are prone to make nasty assumptions about an age gap relationship. There's only so much you can do to fend off these nay-sayers. Ultimately, its your relationship, not theirs, and you shouldn't put their feelings before your own.If you're under the age of 18, you should consider the legal consequences of someone who is older than you. If the age gap is big enough to make a sexual relationship illegal, you should not go through with it.  In virtually all cases of trying to make someone your boyfriend, you should be his friend first before anything romantic happens. Go out of your way to spend time with him. Ask him to hang out as you normally would with a regular friend. If there is chemistry and the two of you are emotionally available, there's a good likelihood that things will begin to take shape in time. For the meantime however, you should simply enjoy the experience of hanging out as friends.  Unless the older boy in question is incredibly shy, the fact that he has more life experience will probably mean that he'll be the one to instigate something. Some guys can be made to feel uncomfortable by a girl that is very forward, especially someone who is younger than them.If it doesn't look like he's going to make a move out of shyness, you should think about making a move yourself. This should occur if he has shown signs of interest but hasn't acted on it over the course of a few hangouts.  This is where it can difficult for some girls who try to attract older guys. While your first instinct may be to be completely submissive towards the boy, this will only go to show your age. Instead, you should take age out of the equation when it comes to talking to him. If it makes you feel more comfortable, pretend he is the same age as you. Relationships usually need a sense of balance between the two people in order to succeed.  If you're attracted to a guy, you can say a lot simply by making eye contact with him and holding his gaze. Flirting covers a wide range of different behaviours, but most flirting begins with steady eye contact.This kind of gaze is best combined with a smile. That way, it will tell the boy that you're looking at him for good (as opposed to negative) reasons.  If you smile at the boy you're interested in, you'll be projecting positive vibes in his direction. If he notices your smile and smiles back at you, it's a sign he is probably interested in you.  Saying something nice about someone can be interpreted as a form of flirting. Complimenting a boy based on his looks or other traits you find attractive will let him know you're interested. Make sure your compliments are genuine, however. People are usually able to tell when a compliment is sincere or not.  Because the boy you are interested in is older than you, it's possible he has different ideas of what he wants in a relationship with a girl. Although you may feel pressured to give in, you should only ever do what feels comfortable with you.  Relating emotionally to people older than you can be hard if you're not used to spending time with you. This is why it's recommended that you try to surround yourself with people that are older than you. Make friends with people in the boy's age range and get comfortable with hanging out with people with more experience than you. This can be hard to do if you don't already have older friends. If you have older siblings, you might try tagging along with some of their hangouts.If you want to make older friends, you won't be able to depend on your classes. Extracurricular clubs are a place where people of different ages will get together with a common interest. If you work a job, there will likely be older co-workers you can befriend as well.  Regardless of the age you're trying to attract, it will work to your benefit if people are able to see that you're a girl of your word. If you make a promise, do everything you possibly can to follow through with it. Don't flake out on plans you make. When you follow through with the things you say, everything you say will have a greater sense of weight in the eyes of others. This includes any older guys you may fancy.  Self-esteem is a major sign of maturity. It's natural for young boys and girls to feel a lot of insecurity as they grow up. If you want to catch the attention of an older boy, you 're going to need to match the sort of self-assurance that is common with his age range. Challenge any negative thoughts that enter your mind, and replace them with positive thoughts about yourself. Even if you have to fake it until you make it at first, you'll eventually start to believe it sincerely.Remember that there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to self-esteem. There's no objectively wrong reason to have confidence in yourself.  You might be surprised how much you'll find out about yourself if you make a regular habit of keeping a diary. Buy any book of lined paper, or keep a Word file on your computer where you can add thoughts at the end of each day. If you become aware of the things you're thinking and feeling on a daily basis, you'll get a stronger grasp of the way other people see you.  Much like a healthy sense of self-confidence, getting past feeling jealous of other people is an important indicator that someone has matured. Most teenage girls tend to be very jealous at that stage in their lives. If you want to stand out from others your age, you'll need to let go of your jealousies towards other people. This is easier said than done for many people, but it is possible. Anytime you are beginning to feel jealous towards someone, remind yourself that there is no one who can do you better than you. Comparing yourself to anyone else is a waste of time.  Even if you're trying to become mature beyond your years, your current circle of friends might make it difficult to break free. Less mature groups of friends will often fall into spurts of drama or gossip. The best thing for you to do is to avoid this stuff entirely. It doesn't add anything constructive to your life, and you won't be made to look good if you're associated with that crowd.This does not mean abandoning your friends. Rather, you should spend time with them, but take a step back if bickering starts. Of course, if a friend of yours is hurt and wants to talk it through with you, you should do so. Being mature can also mean being a reliable friend.  Nothing can make people look at your twice than a new hairstyle. Getting your hair cut or permed will have a major effect on your appearance. You should use this opportunity to spruce up your look and turn some heads. If you're trying to appeal to older groups, you are going to want to steer away from fashion trends that are reserved for juveniles. Aim to make your hair attractive but classy.It's a good idea to pick a hairstyle that suits your face shape. Ask your hairdresser if you have any confusion.  Depending on your age, there may be things you wear that might seem juvenile in the eyes of someone older. While you should always ultimately find your own sense of fashion, impressing an older guy can be easier if you look at the fashion expectations for his age group.If the age gap is big enough, don't wear the boy's age range's fashion if it will look weird on somebody your age.It helps to take a look at some current fashion outlets. This will give you some insight into the latest trends.  If you're young girl, don't try to compensate for your age by using a lot of makeup. Doing so only brings more attention to how young you are. In addition, it also gets the impression across that you are insecure with the way you look. You'll have a much higher chance of getting a guy interested if you stay as true to your real sense as possible. Some makeup to highlight your natural features should be more than enough.It's a fact that younger girls aren't often as skilled at makeup as they will be once they're older. With that in mind, it's good to start small and work your way up from there.  Whether you're standing up or sitting down, make an effort to keep your back straight and your shoulders even. If you're not used to having good posture, this will feel a bit strange to do at first, but it will eventually feel natural if you stick with it.Maturity and confidence are the two major ways you can get across the age gap, and posture is a way of expressing both of them.","[""There are many reasons why you might want a relationship with a boy that's older than you."", 'Most of the time, we see

Flirt with him. Avoid always talking about yourself. Laugh at his jokes. Hang out at his favorite places.,How to Attract the Guy You Have a Crush On2,"Nothing is more tragic than the oh-so-cliche' friend-likes-friend-who-doesn't-like-her-that-way drama. Be sure that you aren't considered ""one of the guys"" or just his ""bud"". Of course, you have to get to know him first and you may possibly just gain an amazing friend in the process (which is all right, some pursued crushes could turn out to be one of your best friends) but be a little more flirty with him, in a way that you're sure one of his ""buds"" wouldn't be.For example, to set yourself apart from “one of the guys”, maybe give him a hug, a playful peck on the cheek, or play with his hair.  Your crush may be attracted to you if you let him share details about his life. This shows that you’re really interested in him and what he has to say. Try not to always talk about yourself; he wants to know about you but give him a chance to share about himself.If he asks questions about you, answer them but don’t focus on yourself for too long. You can steer the conversation toward him by asking questions like, “How many siblings do you have?” or “What is your favorite thing about your family?”Ask about his interests or hobbies by saying something along the lines of “Have you read any good books recently?” or “What videogames do you like to play?”, One of the best ways to demonstrate to a guy that you like him and enjoy his company is to laugh at his jokes! This boosts his confidence and signals to him that you have a similar sense of humor and find the same things funny. For many people, a sense of humor is one of the most important qualities they look for in a significant other.If he says something that you find funny, join in or add your own joke. For example, if you’re talking about a celebrity, you could add something that you find to be amusing to the conversation.Avoid being too mean, such as making fun of other people’s appearances or mocking individuals you both know. You don’t want to come off as someone who will make fun of him behind his back or come off as cruel.  If you know where your crush likes to spend his time, you can get yourself noticed by showing up there every so often. For example, if he has a favorite coffee shop in the area, you could go there with a friend or two on the off chance you might see him there. You could also study or do your homework there.If you know that he’s going to a concert, see if you can get tickets to go as well. This can provide a chance for you to bump into him and say hello. This could even give you a reason to hang out together.Try joining a club or activity that he is a part of.

Try to be included in a group activity with them so that you can talk to the boy. , After a while, strike up a conversation following the ""Hello"", preferably about something he likes (sports teams, hobbies etc.) If you have classes or lunch with this boy, that would be a good time to do so. If you are too scared to speak to him in person, then try social networking websites like Facebook or Myspace. Using these can be easier than talking face to face and good ice-breaker, just remember its hard to have a proper friendship only online.  Be careful to not overdo it.

Realize that being single is okay. Quit making jokes about being single. Improve other aspects of your life.,How to Avoid Being Desperate (Girls)1,"It is common to become depressed or lonely after a tough breakup or when you are having trouble meeting the right person. If you are feeling desperate it may be time to step back from dating. The longer your dry spell, the more desperate you might be feeling. Take a break from dating. Give yourself time to recover from the past and wait until you can be a good partner to someone again. , Even if these jokes are hilarious, they are a red flag that you are suffering from feelings of insecurity. Your self-deprecating jokes definitely aren't impressing anyone. While being a comedian is often a good trait to help you meet guys, it might not happen if you make yourself out to be the joke.  This is one of the best ways to help shake that desperate feeling.

Be confident. Limit your drinking. Keep your emotional baggage in check. Know when it is time to go.,How to Avoid Being Desperate (Girls)2,"Even if you don't feel very confident, take a minute to build yourself up before approaching a a potential date. Envision the conversation going well in your mind. If you are going into a conversation expecting to be rejected, it will show in your body language.

Sometimes a drink or two might be necessary to loosen up your inhibitions enough to talk to a good looking guy, but know when to stop. Going over the line can lead to some embarrassing situations.

Avoid being a social media stalker. Let the relationship progress naturally. Spend time with your friends. Do not be clingy.,How to Avoid Being Desperate (Girls)3,"A modest amount of social media stalking is pretty standard when you start dating someone, just keep it from getting creepy. You can secretly look at every photo of them for the last four years without scaring them off, but try to avoid making it obvious you're watching their every move. Limit your comments and likes to one or two a week. You should have better things to do, even if you don't have better things to do.  Desperate people often look to push the relationship too fast. Don't bring up topics like marriage or even make too many references to future dates early in the relationship. Desperate daters are often asking for continual status updates on the relationship and trying to push for more commitment in various ways. Just let things happen and if you are right for each other, it will work out in time.  Just because you start dating someone, don't put aside your friends to spend all your time with him. Anyone that drops all their friends for a new date, will come off as very desperate. You can't make yourself too available and you don't want to come off as clingy. Staying true to yourself and your friends will set up healthy boundaries and expectations for a happy relationship.  By holding on too tightly, you can drive a love interest away. If the guy is right for you and the relationship is going well, he will stick around. If it isn't meant to be, no amount of clinging is going to make it happen. Most of the time, it isn't even the guy you're clinging to, it's the idea of needing a relationship.","['A modest amount of social media stalking is pretty standard when you start dating someone, just keep it from getting creepy.', ""You can secretly look at every photo of them for the last four years without scaring them off, but try to avoid making it obvious you're watching their every move."", 'Limit your comments and likes to one or two a week.', ""You should have better things to do, even if you don't have better things to do."", 'Desperate people often look to push the relationship too fast.', ""Don't bring up topics like marriage or even make too many references to future dates early in the relationship."", 'Desperate daters are often asking for continual status updates on the relationship and trying to push for more commitment in various ways.', 'Just let things happen and if you are right for each other, it will work out in time.', ""Just because you start dating someone, don't put aside your friends to spend all your time with him."", 'Anyone that drops all their friends for a new date, will come off as very desperate.', ""You can't make yourself too available and you don't want to come off as clingy."", 'Staying true to yourself and your friends will set up healthy boundaries and expectations for a happy relationship.', 'By holding on too tightly, you can drive a love interest away.', 'If the guy is right for you and the relationship is going well, he will stick around.', ""If it isn't meant to be, no amount of clinging is going to make it happen."", ""Most of the time, it isn't even the guy you're clinging to, it's the idea of needing a relationship.""]"
Talk to his friends. Show interest in what he does. Learn about skateboarding. Hang out where he hangs out. Introduce yourself. Ask him questions. Be an active listener. Let your positivity shine. Embrace your playfulness and be adventurous. Wear functional clothes that make you feel confident. Be yourself. Try skateboarding.,How to Attract a Skater Guy,"No one will know what kind of person your crush is looking for better than his friends. Get to know them and you’ll find out more about him, like where he tends to hang out. On top of that, if they get to know you and are impressed, they’re more likely to want to help you with your crush. If the two of you have mutual friends, they are the perfect people to talk to. Think of the following examples when subtly trying to find out more about your crush:If you want to know where he skates, ask about parks in town: “Where do people usually skate around here? Who goes to that park?”If you want try and know whether your crush is single: “How come he doesn’t have a girlfriend/boyfriend?”Ask about their friendship with him: “How did you guys become friends? What do you do together?”;, If you want to understand your crush better, don’t be afraid to learn about skater culture. Like any other culture, skateboarding culture has a set of values, norms and ideals. The best way to find out more is to talk to skateboarders about why they skateboard, and what it brings to them. You can also find many interviews on YouTube, where skateboarders talk about the culture. This can give you a great idea of how your crush thinks.  Beyond understanding the culture, you’ll want to learn a bit about skateboarding itself. You don’t necessarily need to know all the tricks or professional skateboarders by name, but knowing a bit about your crush’s passion will give the two of you something to talk about. Simply knowing what an ollie is (jumping with the skateboard), will show that you care about his passion and he’ll be impressed when it’s time to talk to him.  Skater guys tend to spend most of their free time at the skatepark of their choice with their friends. Give yourself the opportunity to “bump into him” by hovering around his favorite hang out spot.  First impressions matter; it can take only three seconds for your crush to make up his mind about you the first time he meets you.There are two main ways you can introduce yourself, depending on how quickly you want to make your intentions known:You can be extremely casual if you don’t want him to know you like him just yet: “Hey, what’s going on, mind if I hang out with you?”You can be completely blunt and honest. This lets you know right away if he’s interested in you, and you can put a comedic twist on it as well: “Hey, I like you. Want to hang out?”, People love to talk about themselves and their passions. Asking questions shows that you have more than just a passing interest in what he has to say. Some questions you might want to ask him include:”How long have you been skateboarding?” This shows your interest in what he does and learning more about him.”How often do you hang out here?” Not only will this tell you how passionate he is about skateboarding, but gives you a chance to know when you can next bump into him.”What do you do when you’re not skateboarding?” This gives you a chance to find out about common interests the two of you might share.  Even if you’re not interested in skateboarding, you should still pay very close attention to what your crush is saying. Active listening means you’re paying attention to what he’s saying, asking important questions that show you’re listening, and absorbing the information he’s giving you. It might sound strange to do this at first, but people definitely appreciate someone who isn’t on their phone while they’re trying to have a conversation.  Not only will being positive and supportive bring him up and let him enjoy spending time with you, but it actually makes you more attractive to him.Try to see things in a positive light and avoid nagging about your insecurities. There’s nothing wrong with having insecurities, but don’t let them affect your actions.  Skaters, by nature, like to play around, goof off and take risks.Get in touch with your playful side to reel him in: it shows that you don’t take yourself too seriously, and will make you irresistible.Be willing to step out of your comfort zone and let your your rebellious side out. Think of the following examples:Don’t always play it safe. Skateboarders like to take risks; try doing the same, within reason. Try an extreme sport or explore an abandoned building.Experiment. Leave your comfort zone and try things you were too scared to try. Conquer your fears and be adventurous. Go on spontaneous road trips or try a new hobby.Playful teasing. There’s a fine line between mocking someone (“That trick really sucked.”) and teasing them (“Is that the best you’ve got to show me?”).  Style is all about making the clothes work for you, and skater guys respect confidence. Don’t feel that you have to dress up or dress down just to impress him, but keep in mind that if you’re hanging out with him at the skatepark you may need more functional clothing. Think jeans and sneakers, but you can wear jeans that flatter you and you find stylish.  No one likes a poser, especially not a skateboarder. Being yourself will give you an infectious confidence that will get him to pay attention. Use these steps to guide you into bringing out qualities you already possess; don’t try to become someone else because you want to impress a guy. He’ll see right through you if you try to be something you’re not.  This is a great way to gain some shared experiences with your crush and get the opportunity to hang out with him. Ask him if he’ll show you how to skateboard sometime. You might even like skateboarding, giving you something in common with him. If you already skateboard, even better! Take the opportunity to ride with him, showing off the tricks you can pull off in a friendly competition.","['No one will know what kind of person your crush is looking for better than his friends.', 'Get to know them and you’ll find out more about him, like where he tends to hang out.', 'On top of that, if they get to know you and are impressed, they’re more likely to want to help you with your crush.', 'If the two of you have mutual friends, they are the perfect people to talk to.', 'Think of the following examples when subtly trying to find out more about your crush:If you want to know where he skates, ask about parks in town: “Where do people usually skate around here?', 'Who goes to that park?”If you want try and know whether your crush is single: “How come he doesn’t have a girlfriend/boyfriend?”Ask about their friendship with him: “How did you guys become friends?', 'What do you do together?”;, If you want to understand your crush better, don’t be afraid to learn about skater culture.', 'Like any other culture, skateboarding culture has a set of values, norms and ideals.', 'The best way to find out more is to talk to skateboarders about why they skateboard, and what it brings to them.', 'You can also find many interviews on YouTube, where skateboarders talk about the culture.', 'This can give you a great idea of how your crush thinks.', 'Beyond understanding the culture, you’ll want to learn a bit about skateboarding itself.', 'You don’t necessarily need to know all the tricks or professional skateboarders by name, but knowing a bit about your crush’s passion will give the two of you something to talk about.', 'Simply knowing what an ollie is (jumping with the skateboard), will show that you care about his passion and he’ll be impressed when it’s time to talk to him.', 'Skater guys tend to spend most of their free time at the skatepark of their choice with their friends.', 'Give yourself the opportunity to “bump into him” by hovering around his favorite hang out spot.', 'First impressions matter;

"Be ready. Just do it. Even a compliment is fine, guys like being complimented. Pay attention to the conversation. Ask him to hang out. In class, make sure to sit next to him.",How to Befriend Your Crush (for Girls),"You can't go home again, and scold yourself for not talking to him even though you said you would. Or even though you passed up the perfect opportunity just because you thought you were ugly. Or because you thought that he probably wouldn't want to talk to you. You can't be nervous. Relax and trust your instincts. If someone came to talk to you, I'm sure you would probably just flirt back. , The more you think about it, the less likely it will happen. Close your eyes, and breathe. After people start to look at you weird because you just did that; just go up to him and talk. Just talk, So do girls. See? It's not a girl vs. guy thing; it's simply a human thing. Make it a point to talk to him everyday. You can't just talk to him one day, then skip the next. You need to make it gradual. So think of this conversation-thing as an engine when you start a car; once it's on...you keep it running.  With small talk comes follow-up conversation. Example: in class you spoke about the crazy teacher. Next day, or even later next class, you tell a story about the teacher. Or you make reference to her. This is also a great way to create inside jokes- which are ideal. Make sure that when you're talking to him you smile, and try to make it look like you really want to listen to him. Oh and laugh.  Once you talk to him on a daily basis and are perfectly comfortable around him, ask him to go somewhere. It could be anywhere, just the fact that you asked him will make him feel good. Again, this is not a girl vs. guy thing, this is simply human. Whether it's coffee, or McDonalds, just ask. But make sure you ask very chill-y. Very casual. i.e Ha, speaking about obesity...I'm probably going to McDonald's after school with Michelle and Amanda, wanna come? If he agrees then excellent! But if he doesn't, don't start hating, it's just going to McDonalds...right? That's the whole point-casual.  Or when you're talking, make sure you use 'we'. It'll develop an automatic friend-thing in his subconscious, and will make all of this easier. Tell jokes, don't hold back. Say whatever is on your mind; if it's funny...it's funny.","[""You can't go home again, and scold yourself for not talking to him even though you said you would."", 'Or even though you passed up the perfect opportunity just because you thought you were ugly.', ""Or because you thought that he probably wouldn't want to talk to you."", ""You can't be nervous."", 'Relax and trust your instincts.', ""If someone came to talk to you, I'm sure you would probably just flirt back."", ', The more you think about it, the less likely it will happen.', 'Close your eyes, and breathe.', 'After people start to look at you weird because you just did that; just go up to him and talk.', 'Just talk, So do girls.', 'See?', ""It's not a girl vs. guy thing; it's simply a human thing."", 'Make it a point to talk to him everyday.', ""You can't just talk to him one day, then skip the next."", 'You need to make it gradual.', ""So think of this conversation-thing as an engine when you start a car; once it's on...you keep it running."", 'With small talk comes follow-up conversation.', 'Example: in class you spoke about the crazy teacher.', 'Next day, or even later next class, you tell a story about the teacher.', 'Or you make reference to her.', 'This is also a great way to create inside jokes- which are ideal.', ""Make sure that when you're talking to him you smile, and try to make it look like you really want to listen to him."", 'Oh and laugh.', 'Once you talk to him on a daily basis and are perfectly comfortable around him, ask him to go somewhere.', 'It could be anywhere, just the fact that you asked him will make him feel good.', 'Again, this is not a girl vs. guy thing, this is simply human.', ""Whether it's coffee, or McDonalds, just ask."", 'But make sure you ask very chill-y.

"Make eye contact — and then break it. Stand out to him. Don’t be intimidated. Do your own thing. Ignore him a little bit. Play hard to get. Keep your friends out of it. Wow him with your confidence. Take charge. Be tough. Challenge him. Don’t try to be a bad girl if you’re not. Avoid showing off. Don’t try to change him. Have fun while it lasts. Make sure he’s not abusive. Don’t let him boss you around. Don’t put pressure on him. Don’t be jealous or possessive. If it doesn’t work, don’t underestimate the nice guys.",How to Attract a Bad Boy,"If you want to get a bad boy’s attention, then you have to show him just a tiny bit of interest before letting him see that you've got better things to do. Just look at him for two seconds — try looking down and looking up through your lashes for an extra sexy effect — and then turn away. Stare at him long enough to make an impression but not for so long that you look like you really care whether or not he likes you.Bad boys like girls who want to give them a run for their money. They don’t want girls who fawn all over them or give them their heart right away.Once he notices you, turn away. That should give him enough incentive to pursue you. Of course, you can also take the initiative and pursue him first. , Bad boys don’t go for the girls who blend in with the crowd. They go for the girls who don’t quite fit in, who are worth a second look, and who don’t try to look, act, or dress like everyone else. If you have a funky fashion sense, stick to it. If you have an unusual laugh, don’t hide it. If you love sketching, playing the harmonica, or practicing karate, let him see what you love to do and don’t be ashamed of it.Bad boys want girls who know what they’re about. If you look like everyone else and have nothing special going for you, then he won’t be impressed. If you stand out, even if it means you’re not like most girls, he’ll be even more into you.  A lot of girls are intimidated by bad boys because they think they’re too cool to give them a second of their time. If you want to attract one of them, the best thing you can do is to show them that you’re not afraid of them at all. Think of it like coming face-to-face with a bear or a lion; the second you show fear, you’ll be destroyed. If he comes up to you, don’t back away and stand even taller instead. If he tries to interrupt you, then let him know you’re not finished speaking and say what you have to say.Bad boys are used to girls who bend at their will. If you stand up to him and let him see you as an equal, then he’ll be truly impressed by you.  Bad boys don’t like girls who do what everyone else is doing. Just because all of your friends are taking Art History, take The History of Motorcycles, if that’s what you’re into. If all of your friends love Taylor Swift, have pride in your love for The Stones or more indie bands like Bottomless Pit. If the crowd is lining up to see the latest Will Ferrell movie, go for the indie flick you've been meaning to catch instead.Though you shouldn't be quirky or different just for the sake of being different, if there’s something different that you would genuinely like to do, then you should go for it.  Bad boys don’t want girls who fawn all over them. Instead, they’re looking for chicks who can take them or leave him. If you start talking to him and are clearly having a great conversation, you don’t have to run up to him and give him a big hug the next time you see each other. Instead, give him a few minutes to come up to you and make him work for it. If he texts you or chats you, give it a few minutes before you get back to him. Let him see that you have better things to do than to wait for him to talk to you, and he’ll want to talk to you even more.Of course, you should be careful and make sure that you don’t ignore him so much that he doesn't think you’re interested. Find a balance between looking interested and making him work for it a bit.You don’t need to be rude to do this. If he comes up to you and says hello, you shouldn't ignore him, but if he walks by, you don’t have to act like you've been waiting for him to come by and have been looking for him for hours.  Bad boys love it when girls play hard to get. If they feel like they can have you any time they want you, then they won’t want to work for it. Instead, let him know you like him by flirting a bit or giving him a compliment or two, but don’t put it all on the line. Let him reveal his feelings well before you do, and don’t accept every invitation he gives you; make sure he asks you out at least a week in advance so he doesn't think your schedule is wide open and knows he has to work for your time and attention.If he calls you, don’t answer the phone on the first ring. In fact, give it an hour or two and call him back. If he texts you, wait at least half an hour to respond. You don’t want him to feel like you’re just sitting around waiting to hear from him.  Bad boys hate girls who cling to their friends and care too much about what they think. If you want to start a relationship with a bad boy, then you shouldn't let your friends hang around too much until you get to know each other better. You should also avoid saying, “My friend thinks that…” when you talk about your relationship, or you’ll make him feel that your friends are way too involved in your personal life. When it comes down to it, bad boys really want girls who think for themselves.You should also avoid having your friends talk to the bad boy for you. If you really want to win him over, then you have to do the work yourself.  True bad boys don’t want girls who they can boss around. They want girls who are confident enough to stand up to them and to believe in their relationship without questioning them every two seconds. If you want to keep your bad boy hooked, then you have to wow him with your confidence, showing him how happy you are with how you look, who you are, and what you do. Work on projecting a positive energy that shows that you’re content with being yourself and don’t need anybody for validation.Focus on the positive and talk about the things that make you happy instead of complaining about things that aren't perfect.Don’t gossip about other girls or you’ll look insecure. Instead, praise them and the bad boy will be impressed.Avoid seeking validation. Don’t act like you’re only beautiful or smart or interesting if he says so.  To keep your bad boy interested, you should take charge of the relationship. Don’t let him make all the calls, tell you where and when you’ll be going on your date, or be the one who calls first all the time. Show him that you know what you want and that you won’t go on a date last-minute because you've made other plans; don’t let him take you to a bike show if you’d rather be out to dinner, and don’t make him think that he has total control over you or he’ll lose interest pretty fast.You don’t have to take charge with every situation or that may get tiring, but you should try to take charge at least as much as he does.  Bad boys want girls with a thick skin and they don’t want to worry about whether or not they hurt your feelings every two seconds. Of course, if the bad boy is thoughtless or even verbally abusive, then you should ditch him ASAP, but if he treats you well, then you shouldn't second guess everything he says or does and be on the verge of tears if something doesn't go as planned. You can show him your softer side as you get to know each other, but it’s good to work on keeping that skin nice and thick so the bad boy knows he can roll with you.If you get upset every time he teases you or feel emotional if he’s five minutes late, then you’ll come off as a bit weak and insecure.Learn to roll with the punches and only get upset when you have a legitimate reason to get upset. Of course, if he gets in the habit of being late all the time, then you should say something, but avoid getting prematurely upset or throwing a scene over something insignificant.  Real bad boys want girls who give them a run for their money. You should show him that you’re skilled and savvy and that you’re not looking for a man to teach you how to do everything. While no relationship is great if you’re constantly questioning your partner, if you keep him on his toes, he’ll be even more interested in you. Don’t get too comfortable with him and let him know that you want him to be dynamic and interesting and that you won’t settle for less.If he takes you to the pool hall, don’t let him wrap his arms around you and show you how to play; instead, beat him at his own game.If he cites a fact about Metallica that you just know is false, don’t be afraid of calling him out on it instead of taking everything he says at face value.  You may think that all bad boys only want bad girls, but in fact, a lot of them like girls who are more innocent-seeming, or who just like to do their own thing. If you’d already call yourself a bad girl, then keep doing what you’re doing, but don’t feel compelled to wear black leather or dark makeup, to smoke cigarettes, or to curse a lot if that’s not really who you are. Bad boys are much more attracted to girls who are true to who they are than those who try to be someone they’re not.Most bad boys are just as attracted to good girls as they are to bad girls, so you shouldn't worry too much about changing your image. In fact, sometimes bad boys and bad girls can be too much alike to be compatible.Bad boys have low tolerance for fakeness, and if you try to be someone other than who you are, then they’ll be able to tell.  If you’re really cool and hip, then the bad boy will know it without you having to say so. Avoid talking about how much your bike costs, how you’re best friends with the lead drummer of your favorite death metal band, or how you’re the best tattoo artists in East Oakland. Instead, let him figure out how awesome you are for himself. If you brag too much, that’ll be a sign that you’re just trying too hard to prove yourself.A true bad boy doesn't brag or show off, either. He doesn't like people who feel the need to talk themselves up too much.  Most girls who date bad boys are convinced that they can change them. Though there are some exceptions to this rule, most of these girls end up disappointed when their favorite bad boy won’t change his ways. If you want to really enjoy your relationship with your bad boy, then you shouldn't try to domesticate him and make him do things he doesn't want to do; instead, you should appreciate him for who he is instead of making him take yoga or spend an afternoon with your Aunt Mildred if that’s not what he’s into.  If you’re dating a bad boy, then chances are that you’re not looking for marriage with him. Though some bad boys can change, if you want to enjoy your relationship with him, then you should work on being present in the moment and enjoying every moment you spend together in the now instead of worrying about what lies ahead. Have a great time hanging out with him, dining with him, drinking with him, riding his motorcycle, and letting your hair blow in the wind. If you want the relationship to last, then the best thing you can do is to focus on fun.When you find yourself constantly worrying about where the relationship is going, you can have a talk with the bad boy about it, but you should know that this could discourage him.Think of your relationship growing from week to week, instead of thinking about what you’ll be doing in a year. If you want a guy with a clear future plan, then you should try going for some of those nice guys who are always asking you out at work.  There’s a difference between being a bad boy and being abusive. If the guy you’re with is either abusive to you verbally or physically, then it’s time to remove yourself from the situation ASAP. No guy is worth the pain and suffering you’ll have to face from abuse, even if he keeps promising that every time is the last and that he’ll change his ways. Bad boys can be fun to date as long as they don’t pose any harm to your well-being.If you’re being abused, talk to a close friend or family member and create a plan for leaving the situation as quickly and as safely as possible.  If you want to enjoy your time with the bad boy, then you can’t let him dictate every little thing you should do together. Though you may think he wants to be completely in control, you should give him a run for his money and show that you have ideas for where you should eat and where you should go over the weekend. Make sure you’re both equally in control and don’t let him tell you how to act, dress, or look; he’ll like you much more if you stand up for yourself and prove yourself to be independent.Most bad boys, if they’re the harmless kind, like a girl with her own initiate and don’t actually want to be in control all the time.  If you want your relationship with the bad boy to last, then you can’t put pressure on him to move in with you, meet all of your friends and family members, or marry you any time soon. Bad boys like to run free and to do their own thing, and as soon as you put the pressure on, he’ll start to back off. Though it’s natural to want the relationship to move forward, you should know that you’re dealing with a bad boy and that he may be allergic to commitment.Let him move at his own pace. If he wants to meet your friends or family members, then he’ll ask to do it. You can casually mention meeting up with them to see if he wants to come, but you should avoid telling him that your friends or family members are dying to meet him, or he’ll feel suffocated.Don’t compare the progression of your relationship to the progression of other relationships, either. Just because your best friend and your neighbor both got engaged this month doesn’t mean that you two should do the same.  If you want to make it work with the bad boy, then you can’t keep tabs on him 24/7 to make sure he’s been loyal to you. You’ve got to trust him to do his own thing because he has an independent spirit. If you text him every half hour, pop in on him unannounced, or just act insecure when he talks to other women, then he’ll quickly get tired of your routine and will look for a woman who doesn’t want to keep him on a tight leash.Of course, if he’s really flirtatious with other girls, then that’s something you should have a talk about. If he’s just having harmless interactions with girls and you’re on his case, then his alarm bells will go off.You have to be able to trust a man in every relationship. If he’s legitimately suspiciously gone for hours, then you can ask him where he went, but if you freak out every time it takes him fifteen minutes to return your call, you’ll be creating a fuss.  Though you may think that you only want a bad boy in your life, in the end, you should know that there is a wealth of nice guys at your work or near your home that would love to get to know you. If you’re looking for a level of commitment a bad boy won’t give you, then you may have to look elsewhere to really get what you want. Instead of being skeptical of guys who actually want to get to know you without a chase, give the next guy a chance and see what happens. You may be pleasantly surprised.Ask yourself what you’re so afraid of when it comes to nice guys. Do you think they’ll all be too boring, too sincere, too serious? Give one of them a chance and you may see that your expectations will change.","[""If you want to get a bad boy’s attention, then you have to show him just a tiny bit of interest before letting him see that you've got better things to do."", 'Just look at him for two seconds — try looking down and looking up through your lashes for an extra sexy effect — and then turn away.', 'Stare at him long enough to make an impression but not for so long that you look like you really care whether or not he likes you.', 'Bad boys like girls who want to give them a run for their money.', 'They don’t want girls who fawn all over them or give them their heart right away.', 'Once he notices you, turn away.', 'That should give him enough incentive to pursue you.', 'Of course, you can also take the initiative and pursue him first.', ', Bad boys don’t go for the girls who blend in with the crowd.', 'They go for the girls who don’t quite fit in, who are worth a second look, and who don’t try to look, act, or dress like everyone else.', 'If you have a funky fashion sense, stick to it.', 'If you have an unusual laugh, don’t hide it.', 'If you love sketching, playing the harmonica, or practicing karate, let him see what you love to do and don’t be ashamed of it.', 'Bad boys want girls who know what they’re about.', 'If you look like everyone else and have nothing special going for you, then he won’t be impressed.', 'If you stand out, even if it means you’re not like most girls, he’ll be even more into you.', 'A lot of girls are intimidated by bad boys because they think they’re too cool to give them a second of their time.', 'If you want to attract one of them, the best thing you can do is to show them that you’re not afraid of them at all.', 'Think of it like coming face-to-face with a bear or a lion;

"Communicate with your eyes. Raise your eyebrows just the tiniest bit whenever he smiles, nods, winks, etc. Look down and flutter your eyelashes a little. Push your tongue against the skin below your bottom teeth. When your eyes meet with his, move your shoulder forward slightly and then let it drop. Once you've glanced at him quickly, look away and continue on with whatever you were doing. Get close. Involve your hair. Remember to be yourself.",How to Use Body Language to Keep a Guy Wanting More,"Your eyes are very powerful when it comes to body language. They can indicate interest, and indicate if he's interested as well. Eye contact increases your heartbeat and helps to release the hormones associated with love or lust.Fix your gaze on a guy you're interested in if you're not already acquainted with him or talking to him. Show that you're sizing him up––locking eyes is a sure sign of continued interest.Do a face scan. This is a tell-tale sign of interest.Darting glances and second looks can help indicate your interest in him.Avoid staring; he might go into flight mode. Keep it casual and always smile. , Do just enough to let him see the change in your expression, without it looking forced or overdone. It's important to look amused, not disgusted. But remember not to overreact (they'll think you are too interested).  But not too much! This makes you seem innocent yet still interested. As you do this glance down or at the other shoulder.  Open your mouth a little more, but not so much that your mouth looks overly wide (too much and you look like a fish gasping for air). This makes you look flattered and also gives the impression that you're a good kisser, which guys are gonna want.  Only move your shoulder, and not your whole arm. As you bring your shoulder forward, move your head slightly closer to it. As you drop your shoulder, move your head back up.Try looking over your shoulder; this positioning accentuates your curves and invites more attention.  This keeps him wanting more and wondering what you meant by flirting with him and then moving on.  Once he's started to show interest, make him keener by getting closer. Move near him and touch his hand or the base of his arm or gently squeeze his arm, hand or shoulder while you're talking. Nothing hard, just light, quick touches before withdrawing your hand again.Lean in and whisper. Speaking softly will reel him in. He's interested if he moves closer but beware if he moves back from your lean-in; it means he lacks interest.If he flinches or tenses when touched, it probably means he's nervous around you, and that you might be moving in too fast! Try to act more relaxed around him.  Slowly run your fingers through your hair, stopping at the nape of your neck. Once your fingers reach your neck, either trail your fingers back and forth across your collarbone, or move the pendant on your necklace back and forth. Caressing your body in this way will cause an interested guy to watch intently.Watch for his lips parting or touching his mouth with his fingers; you're right in his interest zone once this happens.  Everyone else is already taken!Make yourself look appealing. Acting or looking dumb in front of him when you're actually really smart will make him confused. He will start to wonder if you're all truth or just lies. It's okay to do this in the beginning just to get him to notice or talk to you (in a good way) but once you strike up a conversation, be yourself and act natural!Where to look. When you two are in a conversation, stare at his lips and MAKE SURE you are listening to what he is saying too. An instant turn-off is when a guy thinks you are just taking advantage of him.","['Your eyes are very powerful when it comes to body language.', ""They can indicate interest, and indicate if he's interested as well."", 'Eye contact increases your heartbeat and helps to release the hormones associated with love or lust.', ""Fix your gaze on a guy you're interested in if you're not already acquainted with him or talking to him."", ""Show that you're sizing him up––locking eyes is a sure sign of continued interest."", 'Do a face scan.', 'This is a tell-tale sign of interest.', 'Darting glances and second looks can help indicate your interest in him.', 'Avoid staring; he might go into flight mode.', 'Keep it casual and always smile.', ', Do just enough to let him see the change in your expression, without it looking forced or overdone.', ""It's important to look amused, not disgusted."", ""But remember not to overreact (they'll think you are too interested)."", 'But not too much!', 'This makes you seem innocent yet still interested.', 'As you do this glance down or at the other shoulder.', 'Open your mouth a little more, but not so much that your mouth looks overly wide (too much and you look like a fish gasping for air).', ""This makes you look flattered and also gives the impression that you're a good kisser, which guys are gonna want."", 'Only move your shoulder, and not your whole arm.', 'As you bring your shoulder forward, move your head slightly closer to it.', 'As you drop your shoulder, move your head back up.', 'Try looking over your shoulder; this positioning accentuates your curves and invites more attention.', 'This keeps him wanting more and wondering what you meant by flirting with him and then moving on.', ""Once he's started to show interest, make him keener by getting closer."", ""Move near him and touch his hand or the base of his arm or gently squeeze his arm, hand or shoulder while you're talking."", 'Nothing hard, just light, quick touches before withdrawing your hand again.', 'Lean in and whisper.', 'Speaking softly will reel him in.', ""He's interested if he moves closer but beware if he moves back from your lean-in; it means he lacks interest."", ""If he flinches or tenses when touched, it probably means he's nervous around you, and that you might be moving in too fast!"", 'Try to act more relaxed around him.', 'Slowly run your fingers through your hair, stopping at the nape of your neck.', 'Once your fingers reach your neck, either trail your fingers back and forth across your collarbone, or move the pendant on your necklace back and forth.', 'Caressing your body in this way will cause an interested guy to watch intently.', ""Watch for his lips parting or touching his mouth with his fingers; you're right in his interest zone once this happens."", 'Everyone else is already taken!Make yourself look appealing.', ""Acting or looking dumb in front of him when you're actually really smart will make him confused."", ""He will start to wonder if you're all truth or just lies."", ""It's okay to do this in the beginning just to get him to notice or talk to you (in a good way)"", 'but once you strike up a conversation, be yourself and act natural!Where to look.', 'When you two are in a conversation, stare at his lips and MAKE SURE you are listening to what he is saying too.', 'An instant turn-off is when a guy thinks you are just taking advantage of him.']"
Create a handmade card. Write a simple message. Sign your card. Give the card to your crush.,How to Ask Your Crush to Be Your Valentine1,"You can go all out and make something elaborate, or you can keep it simple – it’s up to you! It’s what you say in the card that matters. If you aren’t very artistic, get a piece of red construction paper, fold it in half and use that as your card. You can also draw, paint, or even make a collage on it. Get creative!If you know your crush likes a certain animal or activity, you can draw or make a collage based on that.Your card doesn’t have to be handmade, although your crush might find it particularly sweet if it is. , You can write a long note anytime, but if you just want to ask your sweetie to be your valentine, write something simple in your card. You could say “Would you be…” on the front of the card, then write “…my valentine?” on the inside. For a little something extra, you could write a compliment like “You look nice today.”You could also write “Just wanted to know…” on the outside and on the inside say, “Will you be my valentine?”, If you want your crush to know it’s you right away, sign your name on the inside. To be a little more mysterious, sign the card as “Your Secret Admirer” or “Your Hopeful Valentine.” You don’t have to write “Love” or anything serious like that if you don’t want to! You could put “xo” which means “hugs and kisses.”For example, you could write: “Dear Helen, Will you be my Valentine? If yes, please meet me at the park at 4:00. xoxo, Jane.”, If you’re feeling brave, you can always walk right up to your crush and hand them the card.

Wait for a good opportunity. Pull your crush aside. Go for it. Send a text or instant message.,How to Ask Your Crush to Be Your Valentine3,"Try not to corner your crush or force them to talk with you if they are in a hurry or busy doing something. If your crush is chatting with a big group of friends or working on their homework, that’s probably not a good time. Wait for a good time to talk to them about it. Since they’re your crush, you probably know when they have a little free time during the day.  It will be a lot easier to talk to them in private, plus your crush might get embarrassed if you ask in front of everyone! Meet them at their locker in the morning before class, or walk with them to one of their classes. Before or after lunch might also be a good time. Start up a normal chat, and then bring it up.If you two share an inside joke or particular interest, start off the conversation with that.  Valentine’s Day is all about sharing how you feel. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Just go for it.You could open with: “So I was wondering…” and then phrase it however you want. You could also start off with “So today is Valentine’s day…” and give them a big smile.You don’t have to make any grand gestures! You can keep it simple.  If you’re too shy to ask in person, this is the next best thing. Keep your message short and sweet. You could write “I really like you. Would you be my valentine?” Add an emoji like a smiley face or heart after your message to keep everything feeling lighthearted.If you're friends on Facebook or Instagram, you could also send them a private message there.","['Try not to corner your crush or force them to talk with you if they are in a hurry or busy doing something.', 'If your crush is chatting with a big group of friends or working on their homework, that’s probably not a good time.', 'Wait for a good time to talk to them about it.', 'Since they’re your crush, you probably know when they have a little free time during the day.', 'It will be a lot easier to talk to them in private, plus your crush might get embarrassed if you ask in front of everyone!', 'Meet them at their locker in the morning before class, or walk with them to one of their classes.', 'Before or after lunch might also be a good time.', 'Start up a normal chat, and then bring it up.', 'If you two share an inside joke or particular interest, start off the conversation with that.', 'Valentine’s Day is all about sharing how you feel.', 'You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.', 'Just go for it.', 'You could open with: “So I was wondering…” and then phrase it however you want.', 'You could also start off with “So today is Valentine’s day…” and give them a big smile.', 'You don’t have to make any grand gestures!', 'You can keep it simple.', 'If you’re too shy to ask in person, this is the next best thing.', 'Keep your message short and sweet.', 'You could write “I really like you.', 'Would you be my valentine?”', 'Add an emoji like a smiley face or heart after your message to keep everything feeling lighthearted.', ""If you're friends on Facebook or Instagram, you could also send them a private message there.""]"
Make sure he knows who you are. Look your best. Introduce yourself. Compliment him. Make flirtatious eye contact. Smile. Say “hi.” This is another example of something that may be easier said than done. Like or “friend” him on social media. Make a statement. Make sure he’s available. Do something nice for him. Be direct. Write him a note. Send a text or online message. Invite him to an event.,How to Approach the Guy You Like,"This is easy if you are already lab partners in science class or you work together in the same office. However, you may have a crush on a guy whom you’ve never actually talked to. If this is the case, there are several ways you can let him know who you are without seeming like you’re stalking him.If you have mutual friends, have one of them introduce you.If he works at a store or café you frequent, make sure to go there regularly when he works. Ask him questions about items on the menu or things that they sell. Be friendly and thank him for helping you.Like his photos or posts on social media if you are connected that way.If you’re coworkers or classmates but don’t normally interact, find a reason to. Organize an office party and see if he wants to volunteer. Sit near him in class and ask to borrow a pencil. , You never know (or maybe you do) when you’ll run into this guy. Just in case you do, you want to look good so that you’ll feel confident about the interaction. Wear clothes that you feel show off your personality and make you look and feel special.If you have a favorite accessory, such as a special hat, wear it. It can become part of your trademark look and help boost your confidence and make you seem memorable.You want to look your best, but make sure you also dress appropriately. You don’t want to show up to work in something too revealing just to impress him, or wear your fanciest outfit to a regular day at school.  This can be an intimidating step if you’re naturally shy. However, most people are happy to meet a new person and feel at ease when someone takes the time to introduce themselves politely.Keep it simple. If you frequent his place of work and he’s become familiar with your face, simply say, “Hi, I’m Jane. I don’t think I’ve gotten your name yet,” next time you go in there.You can say, “I see you around a lot, but I don’t think we’ve actually met. I’m Monique.”, People always remember when someone compliments them. It’s flattering and lets them know that you noticed something about them. Find something you can tell him you appreciate about either his appearance or something he’s done. He’ll associate you with the positive feelings of the compliment.Tell him you like a piece of clothing, particularly if there’s something you can identify about it. For example, you could say, “Nice T-shirt. I love that band, too.”Compliment him on his work. You can say, “You always make the best lattes,” or “You’re a really good lab partner.”, Flirtatious eye contact can come in a few different forms. Generally, you need to maintain eye contact for at least four seconds before coyly looking down or away. Holding his gaze this long lets him know you’re flirting.If you’re feeling really bold and sexy, you can subtly lick your lips. This is considered rather forward, so make sure you know what you’re doing.There’s a difference between flirting and staring. Make sure you’re reading his signals and responding, not just staring at him.  It may seem obvious, but if you’re feeling very nervous or shy, you may forget to smile. However, smiling is important. It sends the signal that you’re friendly and approachable. It also shows that you may be interested.Smiling with your teeth showing and your eyes creasing around the edges conveys warmth and gives the appearance that you’re genuinely excited to see him.  If you feel very shy around this guy, that’s perfectly normal. However, you want to feel comfortable enough to at least say, “hello.”You can wait until he looks at you or catches your eye. Once he does, say, something casual, like, “Hi. How’s it going?”If you generally say hi to him in the halls or at his or your place of work, bump it up a notch by adding something like, “Good morning,” or “Nice to see you.”, This can be an easier step than saying hello in real life. If it wouldn’t seem strange, become his friend on Facebook or another social media platform. This works particularly well if you have mutual friends or run in similar circles.If he’s someone you’ve been following on an online dating site or app, you can use the app to indicate through your profile that you like his profile.When you like his profile or request to be friends, it can be a natural time to send a brief message. Even something like, “Hey! I really like those pictures you just posted” can be a conversation starter.  This can make you look and sound very confident. Say something to him about your surroundings. This invites conversation and lets him know you’re interesting to talk to.You can say something like, “Wow, this weather is incredible, isn’t it?” or “The coffee at this place is incredible.”You can also ask him for help or directions. Say something like, “I’ve never been here before. Do you have a type of coffee you’d recommend?” or “Can you help me figure out how to get to the library from here?”, You can save yourself a lot of embarrassment by knowing if the guy you like is available before you do something about it. If you don’t know him, you can try to find out a number a of ways.Check for a wedding ring.Online, check for photos of him with a significant other.Listen when he talks. Does he reveal a lot about himself and his life without mentioning a partner?Does he keep his eyes moving around the room, looking at people? This can be a sign that he’s single and looking for love.  Doing something nice for him is a great way to let him know you like him without having to actually say anything. It can be a small gesture, but make sure it’s something he’ll notice and appreciate.If you notice that he always shows up to class without a pen or pencil, bring one in special for him. Give it to him and say something like, “I noticed you usually could use one of these.”If you work somewhere that he frequents, give him a small freebie or a discount if you won’t get in trouble. If you frequent his place of work, leave a generous tip or bring him something. For example, you could say, “You always make such great sandwiches. I thought I’d bring you some cookies that I made myself.”, If you can’t tell if he likes you or is getting the signals you’re sending, you can always be direct. This can be very exciting for guys, since they won’t have to spend time guessing about your intentions.You can be direct without being demanding. Say something like, “I’d really like to get together sometime, if you’re interested.”In being direct, you can let him know what you like about him. Say something like, “You seem like a really interesting person. Would you like to hang out sometime?”Some people like to be super direct and simply say, “I have to tell you that I have a really big crush on you.” This can sometimes be seen as charming, but can sometimes put a guy off. He might not know what to do with that information or might feel put on the spot.  This can be a cute way to let him know you’re interested. It can also be a way to slip him your number so that the ball is in his court. Keep it simple. You don’t need to profess your undying love right this second.Write your number on a piece of paper and hand it to him. You can say something flirty like, “I believe you wanted this?”If you’ve never met before or you have no mutual friends, you may not want to give out your number for safety reasons.  Of course, you have to have his number or be connected to him on social media to do this. However, if it’s possible, this can be a fun and low key way to connect with him.Say something more personal and interesting than simply, “what’s up?” Ask him something based on his profile or ask him for advice about something.For example, you can say, “Hey, how was that new restaurant I saw you posted pictures of? I was thinking I might try it this week.”, You may be afraid to ask this guy out, but he’ll likely be flattered. Most guys don’t get asked out very much, so it will probably be extra exciting for him. Think ahead of a fun event you want to invite him to.Choose something that happens on a specific day, such as a concert or a sporting event. Don’t just choose something like getting a drink.Say something like, “Hey, I’ve got an extra ticket to ____. Maybe you’d like to come with me?”","['This is easy if you are already lab partners in science class or you work together in the same office.', 'However, you may have a crush on a guy whom you’ve

"Wait for a time when he feels happy and secure. Find a quiet, private location to talk. Keep it simple and from the heart. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and say ""I love you."",Tell him how your feel over distance with a thoughtful letter or phone call.",How to Tell a Guy You Love Him1,"If your guy is stressed out over work or school, dealing with family issues, or preoccupied with a personal crisis, he probably won’t be all that receptive to a big new development in your relationship.

There are, however, bad times to talk about love:After sex.While intoxicated.Over text or the phone.During or after a fight or argument. , Is there a special place that brings up strong memories for the both of you? You may want to tell him at the place where you had your first date, or where you went out to dinner for your two-month or six-month anniversary. That said, all that really matters is that you have a place to talk without being interrupted constantly.Ask him to go for a walk with you, help with a basic chore, or simply ""come over to talk with me for a few minutes."", Don't try a big gesture or romantic setting -- this isn't the time and chances are good it will backfire.

Even an extra-long, passionate kiss is a great way to slow down time with your man for a half-second. , Some people have a hard time saying the words ""I love you.""

It sounds paradoxical, but sometimes the best thing you can do is not see him at all.

Don't feel like you need to talk or check in constantly to show how much you care. Sometimes giving each other some free time is the best way to show you know and love someone. , Do not avoid fights or issues just by saying ""I love you,"" and accepting your concerns.

You can even tell him you don’t need to hear anything back, letting him know he should take some time to think things over.

If he disappears for a day or two, don't worry too much -- he just needs to process things.

"Ask yourself why you wanted to say ""I love you."",Spend time together talking, hanging out, and being romantic.

But it is also a powerful word, and you shouldn't throw it around with your man unless you're sure you mean it. This doesn't mean you need to write a thesis on your feelings. But you do need to ask yourself what you hope to gain by telling him you love him.If he's already said ""I love you,"" and you know you feel the same, feel free to come out and say it.If your relationship is strong, and you know him and yourself well, it might be time to say ""I love you.""If you're convinced you're in love, and need to tell him so, then trust your instincts and say it.If you want to tell him just to see if he'll say ""I love you"" back, or because you feel pressured to say it, don't. Love is something you give to others, it doesn't expect or need someone else's response.If you're just friends, but want more, you should consider asking him out before saying you love him.  Make sure you can spend quality time together before launching an L-bomb. This will also give you a great chance to gauge his own feelings towards you. More likely than not, if you love him then he will feel some attraction back towards you. Just focus on letting go and having fun -- love is not about forcing your feelings -- so take your time and build a relationship.At the end of the day, this is about you confidently telling him how you feel. If you're not sure if he likes you back, that is okay! That's why you want to tell him your own feelings.Is he comfortable hanging out with just you? If not, telling him you're ""in love"" might come off a little too strongly.  Sometimes you just need some perspective. A big reason many people won't say ""I love you"" is that they're afraid the partner doesn't feel the same way. At the end of the day, it comes down to speaking your mind and feelings honestly. However, if you're a little worried:Ask a mutual, trusted friend if they can see you two dating.Talk to one of his friends and see if he is interested in anyone right now. If you're feeling bold, ask if he has any feelings for you.  Even best friends can be taken aback by the powerful words ""I love you."" You might have thought about this love for months, but for him this is big, sudden news. Imagine yourself in a similar situation -- you have a friend you like who suddenly tells you they are in love. You'd be at a loss for words, to say the least. So don't jump right to love -- take your time exploring your feelings together.

This has been a great few months.""""Let's go on a few dates, just you and me for a change."", Love: the most blissfully confusing human emotion around. If you feel overwhelmed with affection, feel your stomach flip every time you see him, and want to blurt out ""I love you!"" at every turn, chances are good you're head over heels in love. But, as strong as the feeling is, avoid the temptation to immediately tell anyone. Instead, sit back and enjoy the rush of love for a few days. Show yourself that this isn't just a crush, this is the real thing. If you still feel like you love him, then get ready to make your move.If you don't still feel attached to him after the a few days than you hadn't a crush, not love. Love stays around for a long while.  It is scientifically proven then men say ""I love you"" first more often than women.To make matters worst, many dating books are hard-set on the woman always saying ""I love you"" second.

"When she walks into the room and sees you she may look down as if someone said ""you have a stain on your shirt"" and she is trying to find the stain.

"Be yourself. Ask her about herself. Ask her a simple question. She'll start random conversations with you. If she walks by you and doesn't look at you or acknowledge you, it may be because she wants you to think she isn't interested. Does she pay attention to you?,Say something random to her. Make sure to be nice to her. If her friends look at her and then you, or whenever you are talking to her, her friends give looks at you and raise their eyebrows, this is also a good sign, and if somebody says she likes you, chances are she told them because she was hoping you would find out. If you sit diagonal from her in class, her knees or shoulders will be pointed towards you. If you are sitting beside her and she has her legs crossed over and her crossed over leg is towards you this may mean that she is comfortable in your company and likes to talk to you. If you're sitting behind her, she will lean back on her chair, and try to get your attention (for example, copying your habits) and will look for ways to turn around and look at you (passing an assignment back, she'll turn around and look at you). Another sign that you can tell if a girl likes you is if she smiles every time you come and talk to her. Ask her out and see what she says. If you like her, give her hints on Snapchat or Facebook, say. If the girl is online, chat with her a bit, then tell her you have to go. Notice her movements. Pay attention to whether she changes her posture when you enter the class. Here's a great hint that she likes you. Notice when you tease her. Don't talk to her best friend obsessively, as this could hint that maybe you like her best friend and that is not a good sign!,When you're in the hallway, try to walk a couple of steps in front of her. If you talk to her in class and she's quiet and quick speaking, but you talk to her on the phone or something and she's all loud and not nervous, she may like you. Notice when she sits by you in class. Get up a few times in class. If she looks at you and doesn't say anything, then she is waiting for you to say something to start the conversation or give a simple sign to let her know that you notice her, like a wave and smile. If you both have Facebook accounts or something similar and she starts chatting with you within five minutes of your arrival online, and this happens a few times, this is a good sign. If you have known her for a long time, then if she likes you, she will start to change her behavior, unconsciously or consciously. If you are friends and she goes to you with all her problems, it shows she trusts you and wants you to be part of her life. If you play an online game and she is your friend on the game, she might start sending you a lot of presents. If you make her laugh and she puts her head on your shoulder and puts her hand over yours there is a good chance she likes you. If she is slouching forward with her head in her arms, or her hair is concealing her face, pay attention to which way her chair angles, and which way her face is pointing. If you are in lunch and she stares at you from time to time maybe smiling from here to there, she is probably into you. Check to see if she's flirting. Note!,Tease her a little, but not too much.

If she doesn't reply quickly, it means that she wants you to stick around longer because she likes you. If she likes you she'll want to talk to you more than any other person...unless she's playing hard to get. Also, if she smiles while she's talking, or says not yes not no answers, that means she is nervous of how you will judge her.  If she likes you, especially if you don't talk with her too much, she will attempt to talk to you and start very small conversations. If she has a question, take note if she goes out of her way to ask you instead of anyone else.  Call out her name and say, ""Hi."" She will probably just smile because she is nervous.  When she talks to you, does she say your name a lot? If so, it means that she wants you to notice that she likes you.  Blurt it at her and keep doing so until she notices. Chances are, if she has even a trace amount of feelings for you, she'll smile and try to stretch the conversation. If she just gives you a dirty look and turns away, it's okay, just go to the next step.  Make sure that you do not make her think you dislike her at all! Be polite and gentleman-like.  Don't worry if her friends don't act different around you, she may not have told them.  Or if you sit across from her, she will be angled in towards you.

""I'm always thinking of her,"" and if she asks you, ""Who do you like?"" tell her that it's her, or you can say that her name starts with a (the letter her name starts with) and get her to think a little before you tell her. This is a really good flirting method, but only do this to a point, because most girls like guys to come straight out with it.  If she logs off, then that is a big hint that she likes you.  If she is playing with her bangs, tugging on her hair, playing with her hair, or adjusting her clothes when she is talking to you, she probably likes you. Girls seem to get nervous around the guy they like. If she can't look you in the eye, it may be a sign of something good. She could really like you and want to look good for you, or she's very nervous around you.  This is a definite sign.  When you're talking to her (beforehand) have your friend walk up and say, ""Hi."" If she says, ""Hi,"" and turns back to you, she either wants your attention or wants him to leave so she can continue.  If she has a hard time thinking of a comeback she probably likes you but doesn't want to go any further so that she doesn't offend you.  Girls can get jealous.  If she likes you, she'll walk faster to catch up with you. On the other hand, if she's walking in front of you, and she's walking really slowly, it's because she wants you to speed up and walk next to her. If she slows down behind you, don't take this as a sign she doesn't like you! She's probably just nervous. , If she tries to act funny around you, then there might definitely be something there.  See if she follows in your direction. If she does, don't do this very many times. Otherwise, she may notice what you are doing.  If she does the same back, she probably likes you.  It means that she is watching the chat list and waiting for you to come online. However, if she doesn't do this every time, don't worry; she is probably worried about bugging you or appearing pushy.  She may become a 'better' person, or start copying some things that you do as an attempt to impress you. This is also a good way of finding out roughly how long she has liked you.  Take up those problems, and try to help her solve them. Similarly, if you go to her for your problems, and she shows an obsessive 'mother-hen' concern, and genuinely tries to fix every problem, she either likes you or you are very good friends.  This may or may not mean that she likes you.If you sit near her but not very near to her in a free session, talk a tiny bit louder than usual. She may appear to be reading a book, but if she is not turning the pages and if her head is turned slightly towards you, she may be trying to listen to what you are saying. Say something funny, and if she smiles slightly or chuckles, it is almost 100 percent sure that she is listening to you, and therefore likes you, or at least is interested in you. Similarly, if she has a textbook open and is 'writing' but she doesn't seem to be aware of what she is writing, she may be listening to you (this is quite difficult to spot). , She may be trying to sneak peeks at you.  Or if one of your friends are also friends with her, and you walk by to talk to him/her she might look at you and smile or she will look at him/her with an angry look.  Does she touch or play with your hair? If you're sitting next to her, is her knee touching yours? Does she smile at you a lot? Does she laugh all the time? Do you catch her looking at you? These are some pretty obvious flirts.  If a girl has liked you for a long time, she may not do these things anymore. She will probably still look at you from time, but they will be more discreet. They will become better at concealing their feelings, and liking you will be an accepted part of their lives. So if she does not openly declare her love for you, that does NOT mean that she is not interested. Dig deeper!, Also, if you know her favorite animal, then say something about it and then smile at her.  because you will freak her out.  If she says ""I really want to see that movie!"" say ""Hey, Me too maybe we can go see it!"" Sometimes this will work only do it if you've known her for a while and she is comfortable with you.

Figure out your intentions. Flirt with her. Bring up that you are interested. Back off if you need to.,How to Tell if a Girl Likes You Even Though She Already Has a Boyfriend3,"If you decide to ask her how she feels about you, figure out what you want first. Do you just want to sleep with her one time and never speak again or are you in love with her? If you don’t have genuine feelings for her, it is probably not worth your time or her time to try to pursue her. If you genuinely like her, then it might be worth asking her how she feels about you. , Don’t just jump right into asking her how she feels about you. First flirt with her you to show her you are interested. Be yourself and joke around with her. Give her compliments and ask her about herself. Smile when you see her and make eye contact. Try to break the touch barrier with her by finding an excuse to brush against her or touch her arm. Be sincere and not fake. , If you feel like you have established a connection with her and feel confident that she might like you back, ask her how she feels. This can be stressful and nerve-racking but worth it to finally have a clear answer. Be confident but also be understanding that this is a delicate situation and you might be putting her in an awkward spot. Even if she has been flirting with you, it does not mean she must not love her boyfriend.Try saying something like, “I know you have a boyfriend - and I don’t want to get in the way of that - but I just wanted you to know that I have developed feelings for you. I completely understand that you are committed to someone else, but I want you to know that if you weren’t I would want to date you.”Give her plenty of time to think about what you tell her and to navigate her feelings.  If she says she is not interested, then she is not interested. Leave her alone and let her be happy with her boyfriend. Continuing to pursue her is rude and disrespectful. Give her however much space she wants or that you need to get over her.

Get to know your crush a bit. Hang out in person. Figure out if she likes you. Get your crush’s number. Start with a brief greeting. Text with good spelling and grammar. Text in the evening. Text when you know she won’t be busy. Steer the conversation in a positive direction. Revisit topics you’ve discussed before. Give a sincere compliment. Don’t over-text. Plan what you want to say. Tell her you enjoy spending time together. Tell her that you like her. Ask her out.,How to Tell a Girl You Like Her over Text,"Your crush may be the prettiest person in the woodwind section, but if you don’t know anything about her, how can you know if she’s someone you’d want to date? Try to notice the important things about her: if she treats her friends well; if she’s nice to little kids and less popular people; if she’s passionate about something cool. Make sure you like both her personality and her face before trying to date her.If she's funny, notice what kind of jokes she makes. A nice person doesn't hurt other people's feelings to get laughs.If she's smart, see if she helps others, too. If she walks the person sitting next to her through a math problem, it's a sign that she's kind, too. , If you go to school together, or have friends in common, figure out a way to talk to your crush a bit in a low-pressure situation. For example, you and your lab partner could collaborate with her and her lab partner or a project. If you want to see her outside of school, maybe she and her friends can come out with you and your friends.Say ""Ellen and Tyree and I are going bowling after school--want to come with us? You can bring other people, too.""If you don’t have any friends in common, start by simply talking to her. Don’t use a pickup line or anything like that. Just smile, greet her by name, and ask about something you both have in common. Say something like ""Hi, Bethany! Have you gotten the hang of the new choir piece yet?""Group hangs are fun, but they aren’t the same as dates. Remember that you aren’t on a date unless both people know it’s a date.This means it’s no fair to act like you’re inviting a ton of friends to the movies, when you’re only inviting her.  Girls aren’t a different species, and they don’t need to be decoded. You won’t be able to know if she likes you just because she plays with her hair or touches your shoulder a certain amount of times. What you can tell is if she enjoys spending time with you. If her face lights up when she sees you, or if you have a great time swapping jokes whenever you hang out, you’re probably on the right track.If a girl touches your arm or shoulder a lot, it’s a sign that she feels comfortable around you, which is a good sign.If she initiates plans with you (for instance, by signaling that she wants to be conversation partners in Spanish class), that means she enjoys your company.If conversation flows naturally when you’re together, you probably have both mutual interests and compatible communication styles. That’s also good news.  Once you’re friendly, and if you’re still interested in your crush, take the next step and get her phone number. If you both hang out and talk already, this won’t be a outrageous request, so stay calm.When you ask, say something simple and matter of fact, like “Can we trade numbers? I want to be the first to hear your opinions on the new Marvel movie.”If you’re working on a project together, this’ll be even more natural. Say “We'll probably need to meet over the weekend to lay out the newspaper together. Can I text you?”You can also make this part of planning a group hang. Say “I’m stoked for the concert with you, Brian, and Jessica. Can I have your number so we can make sure we meet in the same place?”, When you’ve started texting your crush, it’s best to begin in a friendly, open-ended way. A salutation and question initiates conversation, and allows you to gauge whether she’s busy or preoccupied. For example, send a text that says “Hi, what are you up to?” or “Hello, how are you today?”Don’t just say “hi” or “hey.” It sounds lazy, and she might not know what to say in response.Use follow-up questions, too. All girls--all people--like to feel that they’re interesting. Ask her to tell you more about her quirky dance teacher, her semifinal softball game, or what it’s like to babysit her little brother.  Texting etiquette is complicated. For instance, everyone knows that ending every text with a period makes you sound angry. You don’t need to write an English paper, but do your best to check your spelling and not put commas where they don’t belong. This will show her that you like her enough to put thought into your writing.""Hi, what's up? Is the math homework destroying you as badly as it's destroying me?"" looks a lot better than ""hi whats ^ is the math hmwrk killing u 2"", Most people are more relaxed in the evening, following a busy day at school or work. You’ll have more time to respond to each other’s thoughts this way. Plus, communicating with her at night can feel more romantic than telling her you like her in broad daylight.Make sure not to text after bedtime, which can feel invasive. Wind down the texts after 10 PM or so.  You want to be able to give your full attention to the conversation, and you want her to be able to give you attention too. This means that it's best not to text her when she's told you about other plans. If she’s told you that she’s going out with friends, for instance, give her a little space. You can always text her tomorrow and ask how her girl's-night-out went.It works the other way, too--don’t text her right before a movie if you know you’ll be distracted.  The more upbeat and positive the conversation, the more receptive a girl will be when you tell her you like her. Try to stay away from negative topics that can ruin the mood, such as problems at school or work, or controversial subjects that can upset her and turn conversation sour.Talk about pop culture you have in common. If you’re both giant Potterheads, ask how she feels about the new movie trailer.Joke about something in your daily life you both share. If the school lunch was an inedible casserole, ask if she’s having nightmares about it too.  This shows you’re a good listener and that you care, and that you pay attention to everything she shares with you. For example, if she once mentioned that she likes bowling, ask about her highest score or favorite alley.  This is often more effective than telling a girl you like her, because it shows you understand her and recognize her best qualities. For example, if you like her knowledge of comics, tell her that you learn something new about the X-Men every time you talk to her.Avoid complimenting your crush’s physical characteristics, like her body or eyes, at this stage. It can come off as creepy.If your crush has recently rocked a performance or other big event, congratulate her on her skills.  Texting is fun, but too much of it can become really intense. If you’re texting your crush for several hours a day, it might be time to dial it back a bit. This is especially true if you seem to be putting more effort into your texts than she is.If you text your crush twice and she doesn’t respond, back off for a while.If she’s into you, she’ll text you again when she’s ready.Don’t go too far in the other direction and never text her back. You may be trying to play it cool, but if she feels ignored, she’ll feel bad.  You don’t need to write yourself a perfect script, but take a little time and figure out when and how to tell your crush that you’re into her. If you think ahead a little bit, you’re less likely to fumble and forget yourself, or blurt out something too intense (“I’ve had a crush on you for seven years!”).Consider that it’s often better to ask someone on a clearly-defined date. This way, you’re telling her that you like her and giving her an opportunity for an action plan.Know how you’ll deal if you’re rejected. Rejection happens to everyone, and it’s not the end of the world. It’s easiest to say something like “Thank you for telling me! I enjoy hanging out with you as friends, so no worries,” take a bit of space, then return to the friendship after a couple weeks.  This is a confident, indirect way to tell a girl you like her without actually saying you like her. Send this text after hanging out together, or even after an official date. Say something like “I had fun with you tonight and enjoyed your company! Can’t wait to do it again.”, Be simple and direct. This shows that you’re confident and feel strongly enough about your feelings that you’re willing to admit it word for word. Make your statement more personal by sharing what you like most about her. For example, say “I’m into you because you're so passionate about social justice,” or “I like you because you're sunny enough to brighten anyone's day.”Just like when you’re complimenting a girl, mention something specific about her personality that you like. Tell her that she cracks you up whenever you hang out, or that her commitment to saving the environment is powerful and cool.  Now that you’ve laid your feelings bare, you probably want to take your relationship a step further by dating. The only way to date a girl is, of course, to go on a date with her. After you’ve told her you like her, invite her on an outing for just the two of you. Make it clear that it’s not a “group hang” or a casual thing--it’s a real date.When you’re asking someone out, always suggest a specific date and time. Say something like ""Want to get deep-dish and see the school play Friday night?"" This way, if she likes you but can’t make it, she’ll reschedule. If she’s not interested, it’ll be a lot easier on your feelings to hear “I’m sorry, I can’t make it” then “I don’t feel that way about you.”Plan the date around things you both like. If you’re both into mini-golf and milkshakes, ask ""Want to go to my favorite range on Thursday after school? We can stop by the diner for milkshakes after.""","['Your crush may be the prettiest person in the woodwind section, but if you don’t know anything about her, how can you know if she’s someone you’d want to date?', 'Try to notice the important things about her: if she treats her friends well; if she’s nice to little kids and less popular people; if she’s passionate about something cool.', 'Make sure you like both her personality and her face before trying to date her.', ""If she's funny, notice what kind of jokes she makes."", ""A nice person doesn't hurt other people's feelings to get laughs."", ""If she's smart, see if she helps others, too."", ""If she walks the person sitting next to her through a math problem, it's a sign that she's kind, too."", ', If you go to school together, or have friends in common, figure out a way to talk to your crush a bit in a low-pressure situation.', 'For example, you and your lab partner could collaborate with her and her lab partner or a project.', 'If you want to see her outside of school, maybe she and her friends can come out with you and your friends.', 'Say ""Ellen and Tyree and I are going bowling after school--want to come with us?', 'You can bring other people, too.', '""If you don’t have any friends in common, start by simply talking to her.', 'Don’t use a pickup line or anything like that.', 'Just smile, greet her by name, and ask about something you both have in common.', 'Say something like ""Hi, Bethany!', 'Have you gotten the hang of the new choir piece yet?""Group hangs are fun, but they aren’t the same as dates.', 'Remember that you aren’t on a date unless both people know it’s a date.', 'This means it’s no fair to act like you’re inviting a ton of friends to the movies, when you’re only inviting her.', 'Girls aren’t a different species, and they don’t need to be decoded.', 'You won’t be able to know if she likes you just because she plays with her hair or touches your shoulder a certain amount of times.', 'What you can tell is if she enjoys spending time with you.', 'If her face lights up when she sees you, or if you have a great time swapping jokes whenever you hang out, you’re probably on the right track.', 'If a girl touches your arm or shoulder a lot, it’s a sign that she feels comfortable around you, which is a good sign.', 'If she initiates plans with you (for instance, by signaling that she wants to be conversation partners in Spanish class), that means she enjoys your company.', 'If conversation flows naturally when you’re together, you probably have both mutual interests and compatible communication styles.', 'That’s also good news.', 'Once you’re friendly, and if you’re still interested in your crush, take the next step and get her phone number.', 'If you both hang out and talk already, this won’t be a outrageous request, so stay calm.', 'When you ask, say something simple and matter of fact, like “Can we trade numbers?', 'I want to be the first to hear your opinions on the new Marvel movie.', '”If you’re working on a project together, this’ll be even more natural.', ""Say “We'll probably need to meet over the weekend to lay out the newspaper together."", 'Can I text you?”You can also make this part of planning a group hang.', 'Say “I’m stoked for the concert with you, Brian, and Jessica.', 'Can I have your number so we can make sure we meet in the same place?”', ', When you’ve started texting your crush, it’s best to begin in a friendly, open-ended way.', 'A salutation and question initiates conversation, and allows you to gauge whether she’s busy or preoccupied.', 'For example, send a text that says “Hi, what are you up to?”', 'or “Hello, how are you today?”Don’t just say “hi” or “hey.”', 'It sounds lazy, and she might not know what to say in response.', 'Use follow-up questions, too.', 'All girls--all people--like to feel that they’re interesting.

Find common ground. Be yourself instead of someone else. Dress in a way that makes you comfortable. Be friendly — to everyone. Show a real interest in them. Wow them with your confidence. Talk about the things that actually interest you. Know when you should change the subject. Compliment them. Ask them questions. Be okay with poking fun at yourself. Don’t act like a girly girl if that’s not who you are. Don’t get your girlfriends to talk to guys for you. Don’t laugh at everything. Don’t try to show off. Don’t make fun of other girls.,How to Act Around Guys,"One thing you can do around guys is to look for things you have in common so you can get an interesting conversation going. It doesn’t have to be super deep and can be as simple as your mutual affection for Community or your lifelong love for the Cubs. Look at the guy’s clothes, binders, or notebooks for clues about what you may have in common and start a lighthearted discussion about it.You don’t have to find it immediately. If you get a guy talking for a few minutes or more, you’ll be able to latch on to something pretty soon. This is better than coming right out and asking him what all of his favorite bands, hobbies, or movies are, though you can get around to that eventually.You can also check out a guy’s Facebook profile for hints of the stuff he likes, if you’re nervous about striking up a conversation. , Though “be yourself” may sound like super corny advice, it can be the best advice you get. If you really want guys to like you and to get to know you, then all you can do is to be the person you were meant to be. Of course, if you want to wait for them to really get to know you or avoid topics that may be more suited for your girlfriends, that’s fine, but you shouldn’t change who you are just to fit an idea of what the guys may expect you to do or say.When you talk to a guy, don’t act like a version of a girl you think he might like more, and don’t try to mimic one of the most popular girls in your high school. This won’t get you nearly as far as sharing your true self with others.If you’re more shy, you don’t have to put it all out there at once. Just open up to guys little by little as you become friends with them.  You can wear whatever makes you feel good. If you like babydoll dresses, then wear them all you want. If you’re into leggings and long shirts, skirts and tanktops, or jeans and t-shirts, then that’s fine, too. You shouldn’t wear clothes that are tighter or more revealing than you’re comfortable with just to fit an image of what you think guys are into. You’ll look the best when you’re clearly comfortable with what you’re wearing.Don’t feel like you’re limited to one style or image, whether you’re more grungy or super girly. You can rock leather jeans one week and a pink babydoll dress the next. What matters is that you feel like yourself in whatever you wear.  You may think that guys will think you’re cool if you’re mean to people whom you deem unworthy of you or somehow inferior, but in fact, the best thing to do is to be friendly to everyone around unless they give you a reason not to be. Whether you’re talking to the quiet guy in your homeroom for the first time or striking up a conversation with the new guy in school, make a point of having a smile on your face, asking questions, and being friendly. Guys will see that you’re a person they want to be around.If you’re more shy, then you don’t have to suddenly become super outgoing. But you should make an effort to at least smile and wave at people and to introduce yourself to new people when you can.  If you want to have a great time hanging out with guys, then you have to show that you really care about them, whether you like them romantically or not. Just show that you care by asking them questions about their lives, complimenting them, looking like you care about how they’re feeling, and making eye contact when you talk to them. Don’t switch the conversation to yourself every chance you get or keep checking your phone when they’re trying to talk to you. Instead, take the time to let them know they matter.Of course, it can be tricky to let a guy know you care about him when you don’t have romantic feelings for him. Just be fun and friendly and make it clear that you’re only looking for friendship.  You may think that every girl but you is feeling confident about who she is, what she does, and how she looks. However, you’d be surprised by just how many girls are plagued by insecurity and try to mask it with a big smile or a mean attitude. You can be better than that. Work on loving the person who you are, being kind to the people around you, and feeling capable of doing anything. If you have a positive attitude and a great energy, then guys will like being around you.Don’t talk about how much weight you need to lose or how much you hate being tall. Instead, focus on the things you like about yourself.Of course, it can take years to truly love yourself. But you can take steps in this direction by accepting what you can’t change and working on changing what you can.  You don’t want to change who you are just to get the attention of a guy, especially if it means pretending to love Star Wars or talking about a band you can’t stand for hours. Talk about your favorite TV shows, a great movie you just saw, the hobby you most care about, or really any of the things you care about, and guys will be drawn to your passion. Think about it as not being different from talking to your girlfriends about everyday things — except that you can avoid talking about the guys you like!The subject of your conversation is less important than making sure that you and the guys you talk to maintain a fair balance between talking and listening. Try not to dominate any conversation and leave room for other people to talk.If you’re talking to a guy one-on-one, try not to do more than about half the talking.  Though it’s important to feel comfortable actually talking about the things that matter to you, you should also be able to get a sense of when a guy is starting to lose interest. If you’ve been talking about your horse for twenty minutes and you see the guy shifting on his feet, checking his phone, or looking around for a friend who can give him a save, then you can shift subjects by asking him a question instead.Learn to read body language and facial expressions to see whether or not a guy is listening to you. If he’s listening, he’ll be making eye contact (unless he’s super shy or has a crush on you!), and turning his body toward you instead of away.  One thing you can do is to offer a subtle compliment to a guy from time to time. You don’t have to tell him he has the world’s most beautiful eyes or that he’s a big hunk, but you can compliment a new shirt the guy is wearing, tell him he did great in yesterday’s basketball game, or just make a kind, lighthearted comment that lets the guy know you care. You don’t have to actually have a crush on the guy to give him a compliment, either.You can say something like, “You’re so good at chemistry. How do you do it?” Or, “You have such a unique laugh. I could tell it was you from the other side of the hall.”, If you want to have a good time hanging out with guys, then you should ask them about themselves from time to time without interrogating them. You can get to know them little by little and show that you care about the things that matter to them. You don’t need to interview them, but you should ask them a question or two in the course of a conversation. Here are some things you can ask them about to show them you care:Their favorite bandsTheir hobbiesTheir favorite TV shows, movies, or actorsTheir weekend plansTheir pets, Guys like girls who don’t take themselves too seriously. While it’s not attractive to actually put yourself down or to make fun of yourself in a real way, like saying that you’re fat, that you’re stupid, or that you hate something about yourself, some light humor can show that you’re a fun, easygoing person. This is different from bad-mouthing yourself in hopes that someone will give you some attention; just learn to laugh at yourself and the rest of your life will be much easier.For example, you can make a comment like, “Big surprise, I tripped again,” or, “I wonder how many more pink sweaters I can wear,” to show guys that you’re aware of your goofy or endearing qualities while not being committed to perfection.  If you would describe yourself as a girly girl, like to wear dresses and emphasize your feminine qualities, then you should keep doing that. But if you’re more of a tomboy, then you should be proud to be who you are and not try to giggle more than usual, play with your hair more than usual, or just change who you are to be more girly because you think that’s what guys want. The most important thing is that you act like yourself, and guys will be impressed.You can also mix it up. If you’re more of a tomboy but want to put on a dress or a skirt once in a while, no one is stopping you.  If you have a crush on a guy and have something to say to him about it, then make sure you do it yourself. Sure, it’s easier and less stressful to have one of your friends talk to the guy for you to tell him what you’re thinking, but if you do it yourself, you’ll start an easier flow of communication and the guy will be impressed by your confidence. The worst that can happen is that he may not return your feelings, but at least you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you had the courage to talk to him to begin with.If you’re really shy about telling a guy you like him in person, you can pass him a note or talk to him online. The most important thing is that it’s coming from you directly.  Again, another misconception girls have about how to act around guys is that they want girls who are laughing all the time. Of course, if the guy you’re around is genuinely funny, you can laugh all you want, but you should avoid laughing if you’re doing it only because you think it’ll make people like you more. You can laugh, but you should also have jokes of your own to share, too. You don’t want people to think you’re just a laugh track.When a guy is genuinely funny, you can crack up all you want. But you should avoid doing it just because you think it makes you look cute.  You may also think that guys like girls who talk about how much money their purse cost, which celebrities are following them on Twitter, or other things that may superficially make you more interesting. Instead, talk about the things you actually care about, and guys will be impressed. If you do something that is worth bragging about, then the guys will find out some other way because other people will be praising you.Just work on being the best person you can be and guys will be impressed by what you do, whether you’re amazing at learning foreign languages or have an unstoppable tennis serve.  You may think that guys will think it’s funny if you put other girls down or talk about the random drama you’re experiencing. However, most guys actually prefer girls who are chill and who don’t complain about their friends and who don’t feel the need to put other people down just to feel better about themselves. If you actually say nice things about girls who aren’t there and avoid gossip, guys will like you more because they’ll see that you’re easygoing and drama free and will be drawn to you.If you put down other girls, then it’ll be a sign of your insecurity, and guys will see that you’re only doing it to try to make yourself look better. Instead, praise other girls to show how comfortable you are with what you have to offer.","['One thing you can do around guys is to look for things you have in common so you can get an interesting

Try to catch her staring at you. See if she blushes around you -- a lot. See if she giggles a lot around you. See how her friends act when she passes by. See if she looks for excuses to hang out. See if she pays more attention to her looks around you. Notice her body language. See how she acts around other guys.,How to Tell if a Girl Has a Crush on You1,"This one is a giveaway. If you look across the room in class or at a party and catch her looking right at you, then she may have a crush on you.

See if she teases you. Notice if she compliments you. See if she looks for every excuse to talk to you. Notice if she asks if you like anyone. Notice what she says about any girls you hang out with. See if she hints that she wants a boyfriend. See what she says about other guys. See if she calls or texts you a lot.,How to Tell if a Girl Has a Crush on You2,"If the girl teases you, then it's another sure-fire sign that she has a crush on you. Teasing is just one form of flirting, and it's her way of letting you know she has a crush on you while being playful. If she teases you, then she'll make fun of your clothes, playfully push or shove you, or even make fun of your hair or new shoes. Don't be offended -- this is just her way to let you know that she's paying attention to you.See if she teases all of the guys, or just you. If she teases everyone, then she may just be a playful person. But if it's just you, then you're special to her.  If the girl is always giving you complements, then there's a good chance she has a crush on you. If she tells you she likes your new shoes, that she liked your history presentation, or that you did great in the baseball game though all you did was strike out, then yeah, she probably has a crush on you. If a girl has a crush on you, she'll like every little thing you do, and she may not be afraid to tell you about it.See if she's the type of girl who is just really nice and gives everyone compliments, or if she only says flattering things to you. Who knows -- maybe she's just really, really nice. But probably not.If she compliments a new shirt or a new haircut, that means she notices when your wardrobe or looks change, which already is a strong sign that she has a crush on you.  If a girl has a crush on you, then she'll try to talk to you as much as she can -- unless she's really shy. If you don't have many mutual friends or other reasons to be around each other, she may come up and ask you an obvious question, like something about the math homework that she could have easily asked another friend. She may even call or text you to ask an obvious question, hoping it could lead to more conversation.If she likes you, she may even try to talk to you about something she know that you love, like a sport or favorite TV show. She could come up to you just to ask if you saw last night's game or to ask what you thought about the season finale of your favorite show. She could share your interests too, of course, but she could also be using them as an excuse to talk to you.  The girl may think she's being subtle when she asks if you like anyone, or when she asks you if you're going out with any girls this weekend, or asks if you have a crush on a specific girl, but you'll be able to see right through her. If she's asking if you have a crush on anyone, she's really asking, ""Do you like me?""There's only one other option -- she could be asking if you like anyone because one of her friends like you and she's acting as a go-between.If you tell her you don't like anyone, and she says something like, ""How can you not like anyone?"" ""You must like someone..."" Then she really wants you to tell her that you like her.Even the fact that she takes any interest in your love life shows that she has romantic feelings for you.  Does the girl subtly try to put down the other girls you hang out with? Does she mention that any girls you've dated in the past aren't good enough for you? If so, then what she's really saying is that she thinks she's the one for you. If she puts down any girls you hang out with, or even any girls she just sees you talking to in the halls, then she's just jealous that she doesn't have all of your attention.It's okay for her to be jealous before you start dating -- just make sure it isn't a problem if she does end up being your girlfriend.  She may think she's just dropping a hint, but if she often says things like, ""It would be cool to have a boyfriend,"" or ""being single is so not fun,"" or ""I wish I had a guy to go to the movies with,"" then she's basically asking you to be her boyfriend. If she's always making subtle comments about how much she wants to date someone, that person is you.There's only one other option -- that she wants to date one of your friends. But if she never asks about any of your friends, then chances are that she has her eye on you.  If all she says about other guys is that this or that guy isn't good enough, or that he isn't nearly as great as you, then she's basically saying that she has a crush on you. She may even say that she wished this or that guy possessed a certain quality -- one that you have.If she says she wishes that a guy she went on a date with had a better sense of humor and she always praises your sense of humor, then she's basically telling you that she wants to date you.If she's always comparing you favorably to other guys, then she's letting you know that she likes you more than any other guy around.  If she's always texting you or calling you, then chances are that she has a crush on you. If she sends you a lot of cute smiley face emoticons, or calls you just to say ""hi"" or for a dumb excuse like asking for the homework for a class that she could get from anyone, then she's just looking for reasons to talk to you.If she texts you a smiley face or just a word like ""hehe,"" then she's flirting with you.","[""If the girl teases you, then it's another sure-fire sign that she has

Ask your friends. Ask her friends. Ask her.,How to Tell if a Girl Has a Crush on You3,"Your first resource should be your own buddies. Ask your friends if they've seen you and the girl together and ask their honest opinion about whether or not the girl has a crush on you. Your friends may have more perspective on whether the girl actually likes you, or if she's just playful and flirtatious with everyone. Ask them to be honest -- if they don't think she likes you, they should let you know.Your guy friends may also know if the girl likes someone else instead of you. This could be helpful information before you try talking to the girl yourself.Just try not to ask anyone too chatty, or a guy who is very friendly with the girl. If you do, the guy may tell her that you asked, and he'll blow your cover.  Asking the girl's friends if she likes you is basically as good as asking her yourself. But if you really trust one of her friends and don't think she'll report back to her friend, then go ahead and ask if the girl has a crush on you. Her friend will mostly likely know whether or not she likes you -- it'll just be a matter of whether or not she'll tell you.Don't make a big deal about it. Don't reveal your feelings about the girl.  If you like the girl too and want to know her true feelings, don't be afraid to ask. Just find a time when you're both relatively alone and in a quiet place, and ask her if she has a crush on you. If you like her, you can even tell her first that you have a crush on her and want to know if she likes you too. Just speak calmly, make eye contact, and give her all of your attention to let her know she's important. But don't make it seem like too much of a big deal or you may scare her away.If she does admit she has a crush on you and you like her, then ask her out on a date and see where it takes you.If she says she doesn't have a crush on you, react the right way. Don't get all upset or offended -- just play it cool and show her what a great guy you are.","['Your first resource should be your own buddies.', ""Ask your friends if they've seen you and the girl together and ask their honest opinion about whether or not the girl has a crush on you."", ""Your friends may have more perspective on whether the girl actually likes you, or if she's just playful and flirtatious with everyone."", ""Ask them to be honest -- if they don't think she likes you, they should let you know."", 'Your guy friends may also know if the girl likes someone else instead of you.', 'This could be helpful information before you try talking to the girl yourself.', 'Just try not to ask anyone too chatty, or a guy who is very friendly with the girl.', ""If you do, the guy may tell her that you asked, and he'll blow your cover."", ""Asking the girl's friends if she likes you is basically as good as asking her yourself."", ""But if you really trust one of her friends and don't think she'll report back to her friend, then go ahead and ask if the girl has a crush on you."", ""Her friend will mostly likely know whether or not she likes you -- it'll just be a matter of whether or not she'll tell you."", ""Don't make a big deal about it."", ""Don't reveal your feelings about the girl."", ""If you like the girl too and want to know her true feelings, don't be afraid to ask."", ""Just find a time when you're both relatively alone and in a quiet place, and ask her if she has a crush on you."", 'If you like her, you can even tell her first that you have a crush on her and want to know if she likes you too.', ""Just speak calmly, make eye contact, and give her all of your attention to let her know she's important."", ""But don't make it seem like too much of a big deal or you may scare her away."", 'If she does admit she has a crush on you and you like her, then ask her out on a date and see where it takes you.', ""If she says she doesn't have a crush on you, react the right way."", ""Don't get all upset or offended -- just play it cool and show her what a great guy you are.""]"
"Get to know her as a friend before ""making a move."",Build a relationship off of common interests, finding common interests to bring your together as a couple. Keep clean and well dressed to both look and feel confident. Smile, keep your head up, and pull your shoulders back to exude confidence. Stay calm, even if you're nervous, by slowly counting to three in your head before talking or responding. Think about what you want to say ahead of time, but keep it brief. Wait to tell her until the two of you are alone and she is in a good, stress-free mood. Talk to her in person instead of through text, the internet, or a phone call. Know that an open, honest discussion is far more important than any big surprise. Look at her in the eyes. Just come out and say it!,Let her respond on her own instead of asking for a response. Have a game plan. Flirt with her through eye-contact, light touching, and smiles. Don't try to rush through things. Continue building the relationship as friends first, and a couple second. Know that you did everything in your power, and be proud of your courage. Understand that arguing or getting angry fixes nothing in this situation. Give her some space for a few weeks. Be open to other opportunities.",How to Tell a Girl You Like Her,"You want to know someone before you get romantic. Think about why you like her so much -- what sorts of experiences and conversations brought you together? You want to both feel comfortable and friendly with each other. If you establish a respectful and kind friendship with her, she will be much more likely to like you back.Ask her on casual dates, usually with other people. Try to hang out outside of work or school occasionally to develop a connection.If she doesn't seem interested in acting like friends, or seems stand-offish, you should re-consider if she is someone you really want to spend a lot of time with. , You'll need something to bond over, so find things that you both enjoy. It could be a hobby, sport, team, movie, musical style, anything at all. The only way you'll build a relationship together is if you can build off of a conversation, so get talking. This will give you something to talk about, but it will also show her that a relationship between the two of you could be fun.  Hygiene is a sign that you care for yourself, and therefore that you're willing and able to care for her. Take a shower, brush your hair, use deodorant, brush your teeth, and generally try to be clean and tidy. Wear your favorite shirt and put a comb through your hair. This isn't just about her -- it is about you. Looking your best will help you feel your best.Don't neglect things like facial hair and fingernails. Keep everything trim and tidy.Smell fantastic, but don't overdo it. 1-2 spritz of cologne or body spray, max.  Smiling is our way of expressing happiness, and girls want to be with someone who is happy and carefree, not someone who is sad and sulky. The basics of strong body language are easy -- head up, spine straight, and shoulders back. Combined with a good smile, these simple steps are proven to be the most effective form of flirting you have.  Don't blurt out the first thing in your head! Slow down and take a breath before proceeding so you don't feel like a chicken with his head cut off. Remember that you should feel nervous. If you didn't you wouldn't really like her. So feel confident in your decision and the butterflies in your stomach -- they're telling you that you've made the right decision.Try to slow down as you speak. It will keep everyone, you included, much calmer.Keep smiling! Just the act of smiling actually makes you happier.  You don't have to write a script or poem, or think of great jokes and stories. In fact, trying to manufacture the perfect ""tell"" is far too difficult and complicated for something that should come from the heart. Visualize the conversation to get mentally ready, but don't obsess over the details.""I think you're awesome, and I really like you.""""What I'm trying to say is I like you. Do you want to go out on a date?""""Hey ______. I don't usually go up to girls and say this, but I really like you."", It may be more embarrassing for the both of you if other people are around, and it puts pressure on her for a response. Find a time and place where you are both relaxed, happy, and relatively alone. Consider telling her ""I wanted to talk to you, can we meet after school?"" and just pick a place and a time.  Most girls prefer talking face-to-face, so try not to call her on the phone. If you call her on the phone, she might think that you aren't confident enough to ask her in person.If the phone is the only way you can find yourself asking her, then go for it. Know, however, that you'll always make a bigger impression in person.Asking a friend to do it for you has a high chance of backfiring. Again, she might think you aren't confident enough to tell her in person.Don't tell her over IM or chat, if at all possible. Telling her to her face makes you seem more brave and confident but it also shows her that you respect her.  Don't be anyone you're not. Let the real you shine through because there's a much bigger chance she'll like the real you than someone you pretend to be for her sake or someone else's.Don't be cheesy with her! Try not to say anything too flirty, because she might not know whether you actually mean it. She might even think you were just teasing her (trying to look cool or something, etc.) and get upset at you. Don't keep her guessing. Be absolutely real and truthful. She'll appreciate this more than anything.Do not say anything stupid unless you are absolutely sure she is going to laugh. Otherwise, it just makes the situation more awkward for you. If you think you can make her laugh at a good joke, don't be afraid to work it in. Girls love a sense of humor. It shows her that you like having fun.  You're not talking to the ground, so don't stare at it! Looking her in the eyes has a way of telling her that you're completely focused on her and that she grabs your attention like no other person. Plus, it'll give her a chance to stare into your eyes, too, and lots of girls think that the eyes are the most attractive part of the face.  This won't get any easier, unfortunately. So just get out with it. You don't need to look like Tom Cruise, talk like Shakespeare, or plan a wedding proposal -- you just have to say ""I like you."" If you're struggling, count to five in your head. Tell yourself that, no matter what, you're going to say the words when you finish:""I really like you.""""I was hoping we could go on a date sometime.""""Let's try to be more than friends."", While this is hard for you, remember that you're dropping a pretty big bomb on her as well. She needs time to think about your words, and you asking questions or butting in doesn't help. Even if she does like you back, it's not always easy to say that you like someone, or maybe she hasn't really thought about it yet. Don't force her to make a decision. Instead, ask her out on a date; this allows her to find out whether she likes you if she doesn't already know.  If she says ""yes""...Lucky you! You're probably a pretty special person and she thinks that you have a lot to offer her. At the very least, she's interested in you and wants to get to know you better. Have a game plan for a date or at least calling her, or else you might make her wonder if you've reconsidered later.  Don't be afraid to flirt with her a little. When you say goodbye to her, smile, touch her lightly on the back and say, ""Cool. I'm glad you said yes. I'll call you about the movie. What's your number?"" Once you've made the connection, be sure to follow up on it a bit!Flirting is supposed to be subtle. You really don't need to change that much about yourself other than the occasional physical contact and willingness to hold eye contact longer. No need to over think it!, Remember, girls sometimes move a little slower than guys, so don't expect to be kissing her the next day. If you get a chance to at the movies — or wherever you have the date — give her a little kiss, but don't expect her to want to move as quickly as you might. Remember, you'll probably get more of what you want by making her feel comfortable, so be patient.  You want to be a good friend, otherwise the romance will fall to pieces. Make sure you talk, hang out, and stay true to yourself and your other friends. Just because she said yes doesn't mean you need to be smothering each other all of a sudden.Make time together at least once a week.Plan dates together.Continue seeing your friends and following your daily life -- she fell for you, not a puppy who only follows her around!, Telling someone you like them is really, really hard. Not everyone has the strength to go through with it. At the end of the day, however, you were open and honest enough to take a risk. She might not have felt that connection, but you better believe other women will.  Don't try to make her feel bad, because she'll get angry that you're doing that; she won't suddenly like you even as a friend. Remember, people are attracted to happy, playful, funny people. Try to look at life in a happy, playful, funny way, even if it seems like there's no reason to at the moment.  There is no beating around the bush -- it will be awkward for a bit. Give her time, to get to know you better or to show her all you have to offer her. You might have a chance with her in the future, but you won't if you're super creepy about it. If she feels like you're clingy or stalking her, you're going to seriously hurt your chances. Focus on being a good friend and don't make her feel like you have expectations.If she changes her mind about how she feels about you, she'll probably be more willing to make the first move, so just wait it out.You put yourself out there openly and honestly -- you should be proud of yourself.  If you don't think she'll ever give you a chance, let life show you who else is beautiful. There are lots of people out there who you might be compatible with; try to open your eyes to new possibilities. Life is too short to chase after someone who doesn't see your merits. If you are truly meant to be, she will come back to you now that she knows you like her.","['You want to know someone before you get romantic.', 'Think about why you like her so much -- what sorts of

"Make eye contact. Time it right. Start with a compliment. Keep the conversation moving. Instead, have a mental list of backup questions you can use if you stumble on an uncomfortable pause. Make her laugh (optional). Close the conversation early.",How to Talk to a Girl You Like for the First Time1,"Spend a few days catching her gaze every now and then. Don't just stare at her, though; instead, shoot her small glances until your eyes meet and she catches you. When she does, smile slightly and look away after a second. You'll probably blush as well, which is all the better - blushing indicates you're nervous, which is a hint that you like her. , When you do talk to her, pick a time that's convenient. Don't try to get her attention when she's obviously involved in something else, and try to have a bit of privacy - you don't have to be completely alone, but her attention shouldn't be too distracted.Make the interaction extra casual (and put a time limit on it) by talking to her while you're both walking somewhere else. If you walk to a class at the same time as her, or you start walking the same way home, this is a great opening.  Paying a girl the right compliment makes your intentions clear right away - she'll know instantly that you're interested in being more than her friend. Here are some things to consider:Know how to deliver a compliment. Even the best compliment in the world will fall flat if your delivery is off. Keep a half smile as you talk - it will make you naturally add appealing inflection to your voice. (Try this trick out when you answer the phone sometime and see if you notice a difference.) Maintain eye contact with her, and keep the tones of your voice up, but lower the actual volume - speaking softly immediately communicates intimacy, and it can make her instinctively lean in closer to hear you. If this all sounds a bit difficult, practice it in front of a mirror first.As anyone who's ever had a stalker can tell you, there's a fine but definite line between flattering and creepy. With this in mind, choose your compliment wisely. Saying something like ""You always look amazing in that shirt"" can come off as weird if you don't know her well, and implies that you watch her. (Even if you do, it's best not to spill that information immediately.) Instead, opt for something general but cute, such as ""Your smile is glowing today. What's making you so happy?"" or ""I thought what you said in class earlier was really interesting."" A good compliment should naturally lead to more conversation, instead of just hanging awkwardly in the air after you say it.Know what to avoid. If you're going to pay a girl a compliment about her physical looks, stick to her eyes, smile or hair. Do not comment on her body otherwise, especially on the first interaction.If you want to play it extra safe, pick something you already know she's proud of. For instance, if you know she's a dedicated violinist, say something like, ""I've heard you're an amazing musician,"" and use it as a way to ask her some questions about it.  You might be tempted to stop talking and just stare at this girl, but don't let your nerves get the best of you. Allowing a long lull in the conversation will make things feel awkward. Ask about what she thinks of a shared homework assignment or an upcoming event. Asking for her opinion communicates that you care about what she thinks, and see her as more than just an object.Use the conversation to find out more about her, but be subtle. For instance, if you want to find out if she already has a boyfriend, you could casually ask, ""So, anything fun planned with your boyfriend for the weekend?"" If she doesn't have one and she's interested in you, she'll let you know immediately.Ask open-ended questions. For instance, instead of saying ""So, have anything fun planned for the break?"" (which can be answered with a short ""yes"" or ""no""), say ""What are you going to do to keep busy while school is out?"" A question that requires a detailed response is always better to keep a conversation flowing.  If you're sure you've got a joke she'll appreciate, give it a shot. The goal is to show her you have an engaging sense of humor, but you don't want to come off as desperate or cheesy.If possible, crack a joke about the current situation or something you both saw happen. Situational humor is more meaningful than a joke you read online.Don't tell a dirty joke. It's not appropriate for a first conversation, and it might give her the wrong impression.If she doesn't get the joke, don't explain it to her unless she asks. Just move on quickly with a new point of conversation.Good humor is really attractive, but bad humor is a complete turn off.

Have a cool approach. Open with a light topic. Get a feel for the girl's personality. Make small talk. Give the girl a subtle compliment. Ask some light questions. Make her laugh. Let her talk. Don't brag or show off. Let her see what makes you special. Play it cool. Know when it's time to leave. Leave her wanting more. Let her know you liked talking to her. Talk about when you'll get to talk to her again. Exit gracefully.,How to Talk to Girls as a Teen Boy,"If you want to have a knockout conversation with the girl, then you have to start strong. When you see the girl you want to talk to, whether it's a girl you've been crushing on for a while or a cute girl you just spotted at a party, you should let her notice you for a few minutes. Let her see you have fun with your friends and not paying too much attention to her. Then, when you lock eyes, stride over to her with confidence. Keep your head up high and look straight ahead.If you don't know her, then introduce yourself. Just say, ""Hey, I'm Brian. What's your name?"" This is simple but effective.If you do know the girl, just say, ""Hi, How are you?"" or ""What have you been up to?"" You don't have to be too elaborate here -- you just want to walk up to her like it's no big deal.Fake it until you make it -- even if you're terrified of talking to girls, just pretend like it's no big deal. , There's no need to prepare an elaborate joke or a pick-up line or to do a backflip to get the girl's attention. Just say something that will make the girl want to talk to you more, and to get to know you a bit. This is not the time to discuss your grandmother's funeral or to talk about your goals for the future. Just talk to her about something you saw on TV, about something your dog did, or about something cool that you did over the weekend. Don't put too much pressure on yourself and start with a light opening line. Try something like this:""Man, my weekend was crazy. I had to help my dad build an addition to the house and I can barely move my arms. How about you? Did you do something more exciting with your time?""""Look at this scratch on my hand. My cat is nuts when he's hungry. How about you -- do you have any pets?""""Can you believe how hard that math test was? I'm pretty sure I got every question wrong. How about you?"", As you start talking to the girl, you should get a sense of what she wants from you. Every girl is different. If she's more shy, then she'll need you to draw her out, ask more questions, and to do more of the talking. But if she's really chatty and outgoing, then you should let her speak and not worry so much about impressing her, and avoid interrupting her as well. Once you know the kind of girl she is, then you can adjust your conversation accordingly.Don't worry if she's shy. She may be one of those girls who is only shy at first, but who quickly opens up once you make her comfortable.Though it's important to be yourself, you should stick to safe topics when you first talk to the girl, before you know whether she has a sick sense of humor or if she's easily offended by inappropriate jokes or comments. The more you talk to her, the more you'll know what you can and can't say around her.Even if the girl is outgoing, you shouldn't let her do all of the talking. Let her know that you can hang with her.  There's nothing small about small talk. If you're talking to a girl, you can't start off with your deepest, most important desires, or she'll want to run away. Small talk is an art, and you can master it just by mentioning mundane topics that lead you to a more intimate, exciting conversation. You have to start small to end big, so don't be afraid to mention the most basic things, even the weather or your upcoming chemistry test. Here are some examples of how you can make small talk turn to a more deep topic:""Can you believe how much it rained this weekend? I was supposed to go biking with my dad, but we ended up staying in the house all weekend. Did you do anything fun in the rain, or were you cooped up too?""""I meant to study for tomorrow's chem test last night, but my little sister was sick with a cold and I had to help my mom take care of her. How about you -- do you have any siblings?""""I saw The Avengers last night. I thought it was okay, but not my favorite. What's your favorite movie?"", After you've talked to the girl for a little while, you can let her know you're interested without coming on too strong or scaring her off. You can even joke around with her a bit, and compliment her by teasing her. Just one compliment will do for now -- you don't want her to feel like you're stalking her or obsessing over how great she is. Here are some ways to do it:""I like the color of your shirt. It really matches your eyes. Did you do that on purpose?""""You have a great laugh. You should use it more often.""""You're the only girl I've ever met who knows more about baseball than I do. How did that happen?"", Once you've been chatting with the girl for a while, you can start to ask her some questions that show that her interests and opinion matters to you without prying too much. She shouldn't feel like she's in an interrogation room, but she should feel like you're genuinely making the effort to get to know her instead of just showing off or trying to impress her without caring who she really is. Here are some questions that you can ask questions while revealing something about yourself to make the girl feel more comfortable:""When I get home from school, I always pick up my guitar first. What do you do for fun when you're not in school?""""Do you like being on the tennis team? I think being on the soccer team is okay -- when our coaching isn't killing us with drills.""""I see you hanging out with Sarah a lot. Is she your best friend, or are you one of those girls with a bunch of best friends?"", If you want to keep the girl hooked, then you have to make her laugh so she feels comfortable and wants to keep talking to you. To make her laugh, you can poke fun at yourself, tease her a bit, or tell her a funny thing that happened to you over the weekend. Don't be too obvious about trying to be funny or telling her jokes, and don't try to make her laugh just by putting people down. Here are some things you can say to try to make her laugh:""I've been playing my guitar so much that I think I'm becoming obsessed. Last night, I had a dream that I was Jimi Hendrix -- man, was I bummed when I woke up.""""Is everything in your wardrobe pink, or are you just wearing all of your pink clothes at once?""""Yesterday, I told coach I had a cold so I could skip practice. But then he saw me hanging out at Sonic later that day -- man, was I busted!"", Even if the girl is more on the shy side, you should still let her talk and tell you what she's thinking or what she cares about. You may be so nervous about running out of things to say that you find yourself rambling on about seemingly nothing and not coming up for air. Make sure to pause between your sentences, let the girl make interjections, and don't interrupt her if she tries to talk.If she's in the middle of telling her a story, don't just wait for her to finish so you can tell her a story that you think is similar but better -- this will make her feel like you're not really listening.React to what she's saying. You don't have to nod along or say ""Yeah,"" every two seconds to let her know you care about what she has to say. Just make eye contact, nod at the right times, and make appropriate comments like, ""That's crazy,"" ""I can't believe you had to do that,"" or ""I had no idea that..."", If you're bragging or showing off, then the girl will want to run for the hills before you finish listing all of your accomplishments in the world of high school basketball. Telling the girl what a great athlete or student you are won't impress her and will in fact have the opposite effect and will make her think you're shallow or narcissistic.You can talk about how much you like the sport you play without telling her how great you are at it.You can mention your favorite class without saying that you got an 'A' on the last paper.Don't think that the girl won't know how awesome you are if you don't brag. Instead, she'll think you're awesome because you're being humble.  This is different from bragging. You can make the girl see what makes you different from all of the other guys without bragging about it. Instead, let her know a bit about your quirks or interests without making her think that you're a little weird right away. This may not be the time to tell her about your spider collection, but you can talk about how much you like volunteering at the local soup kitchen, taking your dog for walks, or writing songs.Find a way of bringing up one of the things you like to do that really represents who you are and wait for the girl to ask for more questions.After you tell her something about yourself, ask her something about herself so she doesn't feel like you're dominating the conversation.  If you really want to keep the girl's interest, then you have to play it cool, striking the balance between letting her see that you like talking to her without getting puppy-dog eyes or practically drooling at her feet. To play it cool, you shouldn't crowd her too much when you're talking to her, compliment her a million times, or tell her how beautiful or amazing she is.You should act like you like talking to her, but that you have lots of experience talking to girls, so if she doesn't like you, you'll survive.Think before you speak. If you're dying to give her a compliment, find a way to make it sound less intense first. For example, if you're dying to say, ""You have the most beautiful hair in the world,"" you can say, ""I like the way your hair catches the light. I've never seen that before."", There are two scenarios for when it's best to stop talking to the girl. One is that she's just not that into you, and is looking at her feet, her phone, or desperately glancing at her friends to save her. The other is when you're having an amazing time talking to her and can tell she's really into the conversation -- though it may seem unnatural, you should leave the girl at the peak of the conversation, if you're not being rude, so she wants to talk to you next time.If the girl doesn't like talking to you, just give her a kind goodbye and leave. There's no reason to make it worse by saying, ""I guess you think I'm annoying.""If you can tell that she does really like talking to you and you're having a great time, then it's time to prepare to make an exit.  You shouldn't pull every trick out of your sleeve, tell the girl every little thing that makes you interesting, and ask her every possible question that will fascinate her all at once. That will leave you with little to talk about the next time you see her. Instead, find a way to ""tease"" the conversation so she wants to hear what you have to say and to keep talking the next time you're around. Here are some ways to do it:""Did I tell you about the time I met Dave Matthews at a Burger King? Oh man, I'll have to save that one for another day.""""Acting sounds so fun. I want to hear all about how you're getting into the role of Lady Macbeth next time. Macbeth is like, my favorite Shakespeare play.""""Eddie and I are going to try surfing for the first time tomorrow. It's supposed to be really windy, so I'll let you know if we survive."", You don't have to tell the girl that you just had the time of your life talking to her -- even if you did! Just one short sentence that lets her know that you had a great conversation will make her feel special and will make her want to talk to you again. Here are some ways to do it:""It's been fun catching up. I can't believe what you told me about your sister.""""I love talking to you about music. I always walk away with a new recommendation.""""Looks like I lost track of time because I like talking about movies so much."", The conversation doesn't have to end there. Right before you say goodbye, say something that lets her know that you're looking forward to talking again, even if you won't get to see her for a little while. This will make her feel special without feeling like she's being stalked. Here are some things you can say:""Good luck with that swim meet tomorrow. You'll have to tell me all about it soon.""""I'll see you in Math tomorrow. Please come prepared with a joke because I'll need a good laugh after we get those tests back.""""I love hearing your stories about your family. Maybe I'll get to hear more at Becky's party this weekend."", Once you've closed down the conversation, let the girl know that you like talking to her, and mentioned a time when you'll potentially see each other again, you have nothing left to do but to smile, lift up a hand, say, ""See you later,"" and then walk off into the sunset. Make your exit confidently and quickly instead of lingering around until you run out of things to talk about or keep shifting feet.Don't try too hard at the end. Just a simple, ""I'll talk to you later,"" will get the point across.If you have a place to go, like English class or batting practice, tell her where you're going so she sees that you're busy and have a lot going on.Give the girl a big smile when you leave to make her comfortable. It doesn't have to be an intense, over-the-top smile. Just smile enough to let her see that you've had a good time.","['If you want to have a knockout conversation with the girl, then you have to start strong.', ""When you see the girl you want to talk

"Make a list of the things that you like about her. Begin organizing your feelings into a letter. Be honest with your feelings. Use some romantic style in your letter. Tell her you want to talk and would like to meet somewhere. Avoid copying love quotes found online, as these usually end up sounding artificial. Thank her for taking the time to read the letter and let her know that if she doesn’t feel the same that it’s okay.",How to Tell a Girl You Like Her in a Letter1,"Don’t worry about organization. Just open your heart and let it spill. Even if it sounds weird on paper, you can always change it later. , Just like in English class, writing a great letter that will make her smile requires a process.  Let her know that you find her special and that you would like a chance to get to know her better.

Develop your interests. Practice saying things out loud. Talk to girls. Stay prepared. Make your approach. Talk the talk. Keep the conversation going for a little while. Stay positive. Take the initiative. Ask for her number. Walk away.,How to Talk to a Girl You Like,"You don't need to be a brain to find things to talk about, but you do need to have passions and interests. A person who can talk naturally about things he's interested in is always better conversation than someone armed with pre-written prompts and a vague hope of getting a date.Make a short list. List everything you're interested in. Go for more detail rather than less. For example, instead of “music,” write “playing classical guitar, going to concerts, collecting old funk LPs.”Expand the list into topics. Using the example above, you might think about what brand of guitar you own or rent versus the brand you wish you could have, what concerts you've been to, and what funk bands you enjoy.Make a mental note of your opinion on each topic. This will help you to know yourself better. When you talk about any subject you have an interest in, you'll be able to speak confidently about it and explain why you're interested in it, which makes for good conversation.  Get used to talking, or you'll never be able to talk well. One of the easiest and simplest things you can do to improve your comfort level is simply to say things aloud to yourself. This helps you get comfortable with the sound of your own voice, and with speaking rather than simply responding to others.Find a time and a place. Whenever you're home alone is a great choice. It doesn't have to be regularly scheduled; just seize opportunities as they arise.Say something. Try to talk a little bit about something rather than just mumbling a few words. Tell yourself about the plot of the last TV show or movie you watched. If you can't think of anything to say, find a book and read aloud from it.When reading from a book, try to make the words sound natural, rather than the stilted sight-reading drone that many people lapse into. Read a sentence or two in your head first, then say them aloud as though you had just thought of them yourself.Books of poetry are ideal for this. Poetry is almost always meant to be read aloud, and the concentration required to be able to read a poem naturally will help distract you from feeling silly.Keep talking for a little while. Try to speak out loud for at least a minute. Over time, this will help you get used to initiating conversations and speaking your mind, which are important skills for making a good impression on your crush.  Wherever you interact with women on a regular basis – work, school, clubs, or elsewhere – make an extra effort to engage in small talk with them. This will teach you that there is nothing to fear about talking to a girl, even if you have a crush on her.Start with people you already interact with a little bit, like coworkers. Ask them how their week has been going, and use short questions to encourage them to talk more. Most girls will be glad to talk with you for a moment.If a girl asks about your week after she's told you about hers, do the polite thing and tell her, in about the same level of detail she used when talking to you. (Leave out the fact that you're trying to get better at talking to girls.)Be friendly with project partners. At school or during community service, you will often be paired with a partner. When your partner is a girl you don't know very well, a little geniality will go a long way towards making things comfortable for both of you.Try talking about the project rather than asking about her. If she responds well, continue on, and mix in small talk and simple questions as you go along.Don't ask her about herself or her life. Instead, ask her what she thinks of another person, such as the teacher, or an upcoming event you both know about.Don't talk too often. Show that you're primarily interested in being helpful and completing your project together. Speak as thoughts come to you, rather than pushing the conversation along.  If you want to make a good impression on a girl, the very least you can do is control your behavior and your hygiene.Keep up a daily hygiene regimen of bathing, face cleaning, tooth brushing, and hair care. Wear deodorant. Clip your fingernails regularly.If you wear cologne, remember: less is more. Spray enough onto your wrists and the base of your neck that you can smell it from a foot or two away at most, but no more. Good cologne will dry down and last several hours; there is no need to overdo it.Always dress your best. Use clean clothes, and plan outfits the evening before you wear them so you don't have to make last-minute substitutions.Be on your best behavior. You don't have to stop being the class clown if that's who you are, but you shouldn't say or do anything that you wouldn't want your crush to know about. You never know what might get back to her. Be kind and forgiving with others, and avoid getting into trouble with higher-ups.  Whenever you see a good opportunity to speak to your crush alone for a moment, even if other people are around, step up and do it.Get her attention. Call her name and wave at her while smiling. Look happy to see her.Meet her. Start walking up as soon as she's acknowledged you. Don't wait for her to come over to where you are. Show you're proactive and confident by closing the distance yourself.If she looks upset or bothered by your greeting, or tries to pretend she doesn't hear you, she is most likely not interested in getting to know you. Cut your losses and move on. You deserve someone who will be glad to see you.  By now, you should be comfortable talking to girls, and confident that you're an interesting person with things to say on a variety of subjects. This is your chance to make a great impression with the skills you've developed.If you don't know your crush, introduce yourself and tell her where you've seen each other around. Once she recognizes you she'll probably ask you a polite question, like “what's up?” or “how's it going?” Don't answer dismissively; instead, think on your feet and say something in response that will move the conversation along.If all else fails, say that you just saw her and thought you'd come over and catch up for a bit. This allows you to jump into a conversational lead with the next statement.  Ask her about people and places you both know. Respond lightly when she answers your questions, and use gentle humor to offer your opinions.For example, if you both had a class with a teacher named Mr. Smith who always seemed tired, you could ask her about Mr. Smith, and respond with an observation about how tired he always looked when she answers your question.  Smile and don't be afraid to look at her while she's talking. Remember the old saying: “laugh and the world laughs with you; cry and you cry alone.” We make our best impressions when we make others feel happy to be around us.Leave serious and sad topics out of this conversation. If one has to come up (for example, if she asks about someone and you know he just died), be honest, but don't let the conversation dwell in that spot.  If there's a lull in the conversation, but it's otherwise going well, tell her about a recent event in your life that has to do with one of your personal interests. Continuing with the musical example from previously, you might bring up a concert you recently attended or an album you recently bought.Don't get too into your own interests. Keep it general enough that she can follow what's being said without having any special knowledge. Make plenty of room for her to interject or change the subject. The important thing is to keep your conversation interesting and alive.  Tell her it was great to talk with her and suggest that the two of you get together again soon, then ask for her number. Depending on how slowly you want to take things, asking for a phone number outright might not always be an appropriate step, but it's a good middle ground between simply saying goodbye and asking her out on the spot.Alternatively, just ask to be Facebook friends, or request her e-mail address. This is less blatantly an invitation to date than asking for a girl's number, and most people don't mind giving out online information.  Tell her you'll call (or otherwise contact) her soon and leave her with a smile and a wave. If all went well, you should be looking at a get-together or possibly even a first date within a week or two.","[""You don't need to be a brain to find things to talk about, but you do need to have passions and interests."", ""A person who can talk naturally about things he's interested in is always better conversation than someone armed with pre-written prompts and a vague hope of getting a date."", 'Make a short list.', ""List everything you're interested in."", 'Go for more detail rather than less.', 'For example, instead of “music,”', 'write “playing classical guitar, going to concerts, collecting old funk LPs.', '”Expand', 'the list into topics.', ""Using the example above, you might think about what brand of guitar you own or rent versus the brand you wish you could have, what concerts you've been to, and what funk bands you enjoy."", 'Make a mental note of your opinion on each topic.', 'This will help you to know yourself better.', ""When you talk about any subject you have an interest in, you'll be able to speak confidently about it and explain why you're interested in it, which makes for good conversation."", ""Get used to talking, or you'll never be able to talk well."", 'One of the easiest and simplest things you can do to improve your comfort level is simply to say things aloud to yourself.', 'This helps you get comfortable with the sound of your own voice, and with speaking rather than simply responding to others.', 'Find a time and a place.', ""Whenever you're home alone is a great choice."", ""It doesn't have to be regularly scheduled;

"Be honest with yourself, first and foremost. Remember that she likes you. Choose rejection over regret. Just be yourself. Be honest when giving a compliment. Talk to her in the presence of her friends. Join a club or participate in an activity in which she is involved. Girls are human too. Say hi!",How to Talk to the Girl Who Likes You,"Is she really the girl for you?;, Hopefully, keeping this in mind will inspire confidence since you are already starting at a vantage point. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  It's better to know that you two didn't have a chance, rather than living off false hope! Don't lead her on, but rather confront her with your feelings. Both of your emotions are important in whatever relationship you choose to have with her.  This is critical. It is important that your admirer accept you for who you are, not who you think she wants you to be. Any relationship will ultimately fail if you engage in false pretenses.  It is easy to sense when someone is insincere. Keep compliments brief and not overly personal until you really know her well. An insightful compliment that remarks on her behavior, personality trait or action can be powerful when delivered at the appropriate time and place. It allows her to see that you are not being trite or superficial and that you value her for who she is.  Make sure to make eye contact and include her friends in the conversation. This not only exhibits good manners but it will ingratiate you with her peers. It will also help to make her and others feel less self-conscious if you are friendly and relaxed.  This will increase both your comfort levels and give you a common ground on which to build a friendship. However, if you truly have no interest, do not force yourself to attend. (See #2 and #3 above.) If there is a predominance of girls in the club, don't let that deter you. Remember, your purpose for attending is to get to know her but if that should not work out, you will have expanded your network of other available girls to socialize with in the future. The fact that there are few guys in the club means that you have eliminated the competition.  Remembering that she likes you and probably suffers from the same insecurities that you do, should help to reduce your anxiety. If it is meant to be, friendship is a process that should develop naturally over time. Trust and respect are not earned overnight.  Take the initiative! When you pass her in the hall, say, ""Hi So-And-So!"" Do it often, too.","['Is she really the girl for you?;, Hopefully, keeping this in mind will inspire confidence since you are already starting at a vantage point.', 'Nothing ventured, nothing gained.', ""It's better to know that you two didn't have a chance, rather than living off false hope!"", ""Don't lead her on, but rather confront her with your feelings."", 'Both of your emotions are important in whatever relationship you choose to have with her.', 'This is critical.', 'It is important that your admirer accept you for who you are, not who you think she wants you to be.', 'Any relationship will ultimately fail if you engage in false pretenses.', 'It is easy to sense when someone is insincere.', 'Keep compliments brief and not overly personal until you really know her well.', 'An insightful compliment that remarks on her behavior, personality trait or action can be powerful when delivered at the appropriate time and place.', 'It allows her to see that you are not being trite or superficial and that you value her for who she is.', 'Make sure to make eye contact and include her friends in the conversation.', 'This not only exhibits good manners but it will ingratiate you with her peers.', 'It will also help to make her and others feel less self-conscious if you are friendly and relaxed.', 'This will increase both your comfort levels and give you a common ground on which to build a friendship.', 'However, if you truly have no interest, do not force yourself to attend.', '(See #2 and #3 above.)', ""If there is a predominance of girls in the club, don't let that deter you."", 'Remember, your purpose for attending is to get to know her but if that should not work out, you will have expanded your network of other available girls to socialize with in the future.', 'The fact that there are few guys in the club means that you have eliminated the competition.', 'Remembering that she likes you and probably suffers from the same insecurities that you do, should help to reduce your anxiety.', 'If it is meant to be, friendship is a process that should develop naturally over time.', 'Trust and respect are not earned overnight.', 'Take the initiative!', 'When you pass her in the hall, say, ""Hi So-And-So!""', 'Do it often, too.']"

Stay calm. Smile. Greet her with a “hello”. Ask a favor. Ask a question. Make a small statement. Look your best. Try to make her comfortable. Focus on your positive attributes. Go easy on yourself. Speak assertively. Think positively. Find the best time to talk. Ask her about her day. Make her laugh. Find out more about her. Pay her a small compliment. Invite her to sit with you. Ask for her number.,How to Talk to a Girl at School (Boys),"Try not to overthink the situation. Though you want to talk to this girl very much, remember that she is not perfect and may be as nervous as you. Girls have emotions and feelings just like you do and may be wondering the right way to approach you as well. Or she may be waiting on you to make the first move!.Breathe deeply before you talk to her. Deep breaths help calm you down. , When you see her, greet her with a sweet smile. Smiles indicate friendliness and warmth. You may have never smiled at her before, so she may have no idea that you want to talk to her. Smiling at her will plant a seed in her mind that you have some level of interest. She won’t be as caught off guard when you actually do speak to her.  If you see her in the mornings or walk past her on your way to class, tell her “hello.” This will likely begin to spark an interest in her to know more about you and to talk to you. This also will guarantee that she notices you.Unless you have spoken to her before, however, don’t use her name when you say “hello.” She might find it creepy if you know her name but she doesn’t know you or yours, especially if you go to a big school. Don’t look up any information about her either because this can come across as stalker-like behavior.  One way to begin having small conversations with her is to ask her for a small favor. This is another way to guarantee that she notices you. For instance, you might ask her something like “can you grab a cup for me?” if she is standing by the cups in the cafeteria.You might also ask something like “can you let me borrow a pencil?” if you have a class with her, just make sure that you give the pencil back.  Another great way to begin having small conversations is to ask her small questions. She will appreciate the opportunity to be able to help you if you ask questions like “what page did the teacher say we should turn to?” or “what is our homework assignment for tonight?”If you’re lucky, she may begin to rely on you when she has questions as well and then you can spark up conversations.  You can also begin the conversation with her by making small statements that don’t necessarily require a response. Saying things like “wow, it’s a nice day today” or “this lunch is so good” are great ways to speak to her without fear, because such does not require her to respond. However, she will likely respond to you if she is interested, so continue the conversation from there.  One way to impress a girl that you have not yet spoken to is to always look great. Get up a few minutes earlier in the mornings and take a little extra time to get ready. A girl is more likely to notice you if you come to school looking handsome and clean cut regularly.Pick your outfit out the night before and iron it so your clothes look neat.Maintain your hygiene. Shower regularly and wear deodorant. Brush your teeth and floss.Put on lotion and wear chapstick.Get haircuts regularly to maintain a sharp hairstyle.If you have long hair, wash it regularly and comb it to keep it neat.Wear cologne, but don’t overdo it. Most girls enjoy when boys smell nice.  Be very respectful to her and avoid staring or making forward comments. Many girls have guys approaching them on the streets or on social media making inappropriate comments often. Do your best to avoid being one of these kind of guys at all costs. A girl is unlikely to talk to you if she feels uncomfortable or if she feels that you only want her physically..For example, avoid saying things like “hey baby” or “nice butt” to her. She may think these comments are strange or offensive.Avoid using cheesy pickup lines or making comments about her body.  Though this girl may be wonderful, you must remember that she is also probably looking to connect and make friends with people, too. Before you approach her, take some time to think about all of the good aspects about you, as well. If you are a loyal friend or a kind person, show those qualities to the girl when you speak to her, without being cocky or bragging.  Confidence comes from experience, you cannot fake it or if you do, you can only fake for so long. Be honest with yourself and about yourself.You are probably going to feel nervous to some extent. Accept it!Remember that she is just another person, do not put her on a pedestal or have any expectations when approaching her. Just be genuinely interested in what she has to say and let the conversation unfold as naturally as possible.Some ways that you can project confidence are to stand up straight and maintain eye contact with the girl.  When you do approach her, don’t stammer over your words or mumble, even if you are nervous. Speak calmly, assuredly, and with earnest behavior. Most girls like boys who are confident when they speak and find it easier to have conversations with them.Speak slightly louder than you normally would if you have been told that you are soft spoken.Don’t overtalk her, either. Confidence is not about being the loudest or speaking the most. It might be best to let her do most of the talking. Try coming up with a list of open-ended questions to get her talking about herself. These are questions that do not have a simple yes and no answer. They invite elaboration. For example, you could ask her, “What do you like to do for fun?” or “How was your day?” This will help to show that you are a good listener and you can learn more about her in the process.  Don’t get caught up in thinking negatively about yourself or what could go wrong when you talk to her. Think positively and positive things will likely come to you. The girl will also likely feel this positivity from you and enjoy your spirit and personality. Most people don’t like hanging around people who are negative, so practice positivity before speaking to her..  Often times, lunch period can provide a great time for conversation because this is allotted free time during your school day. However, there are other times that work well, too. For instance, in the beginning of the school day, there is some time that you could make to speak to her. After class is another great time.Speaking to her when she is around a large group of friends could be risky unless you are friends with some of them. Try to talk to her when she is alone or only with one or two friends.  After you have successfully began making small talk with her, you can now have an actual conversation. Ask her how her day is going to show that you are interested in her life. Most people enjoy talking about themselves, so she will likely welcome the opportunity and be flattered that you asked.You can approach her and say something like “Hey, how’s your day going so far?”, There is an old adage that says that “the way to a woman’s heart is to make her laugh”. If you don’t know her, making her laugh might be difficult since you aren’t aware of her sense of humor. However, you can work on picking out little funny things about your school that she is likely to find funny..For instance, maybe your teacher does something that is funny to you like using the word “irregardless.” You could say something humorous like “I think it’s so funny how we have an English teacher who uses words that aren’t words!”, Take some time when you talk to her to find out more about her as a person. If you don’t know her name, start there. If you don’t know what year she is, ask her if she’s the same year as you. She will gradually begin to open up and you can start asking more personal questions like “what do you like to do for fun?” or “what’s your favorite movie?”Talk about yourself some, as well, but don’t overdo it. You don’t want to dominate the conversation. You might say something like “I’m in the 7th grade, too” or “I got into college and I’m really excited about it.” She will likely ask some questions about you, as well.  After establishing some rapport with her, you can pay her a small compliment. Don’t give compliments that are physical or that are overly detailed just yet. She may be put off by that and uncomfortable talking to you thereafter.You might say something like “you’re really good at soccer” or “I saw you stick up for your friend to that bully. You’re a really nice friend, it seems.”, If you have spoken with her several times, then you might try asking her to sit with you. For example, you can invite her to sit with you at lunch so you can talk some more. If she still wants to sit with her friends, don’t be pushy. You can try asking her again at a later time once you have had more conversations.She may be intimidated to sit with you if you sit with a lot of your guy friends, so tell her that you two can sit alone if she likes.  The conversations with her don’t have to stop after this first real interaction. You can continue to speak to her after this, even when you are not at school. Ask her for her phone number and see if she’s okay with you calling or texting her sometimes.Ask her something like “I really have enjoyed talking to you. Can I have your number so I can call or text you sometime?”She may prefer to give you her social media information. You can talk to her that way, as well.Her parents may be strict and may not allow her to talk to boys. If so, be respectful. You can still talk to her at school.","['Try not to overthink the situation.', 'Though you want to talk to this girl very much, remember that she is not perfect and may be as nervous as you.', 'Girls

Avoid cliche descriptions and details. Write the lyrics for the bridge. Switch up the melody in the bridge. Add the bridge to the song.,How to Write a Good Love Song for Your Crush,"Some people like to start their song by writing the lyrics, but if you’re not an experienced songwriter, it can be tricky to find a melody or track to fit those lyrics. Look for a beat that you like, then write the rest of the song to fit that beat. You should also consider using a slower beat if you are planning to write a love song that is sensual and sexy for your crush.Pay close attention to the melody and rhythm of the track and try to fit your lyrics into what’s already there. If your crush likes a certain genre of music, like pop or hip hop, you can also look for a backing track that falls within that genre. , If you play an instrument or are musically inclined, you may be able to write the melody for the song yourself. Start by picking a simple chord progression, then build the melody for the song on top of that.Try strumming or playing the chord progression while vocally improvising a melody.Record your improvisation and listen to it back to see if there’s anything you want to keep.Start with a basic chord progression, like D-E-A or Am-F-C-G.  Sometimes a melody will pop into your head, fully formed, but sometimes you have to work a little harder. Practice singing the melody of a hit song, then fooling around with the melody to make it your own.Change the pitches of the ghost melody to be higher or lower.Where the song usually rises, have the melody fall instead.Try syncopating the beat or adding pauses where there’s usually music.  The hook is the chorus of your song. Some beginning songwriters find it easier to write the hook first, then compose the rest of the lyrics. Familiarize yourself with the beat and melody of the song, then try to write the chorus to fit that beat and melody.Think of the hook as the thesis to your love song and try to sum up how you feel about your crush in a single statement. Brainstorm some ideas, then try to write the chorus based off those. You may write down a few keywords that come to mind when you think about your crush, such as “smart”, “strong”, “hot”, “brave”, or “sensual.”The lyrics for the chorus can be very simple like “Hit me baby one more time” or “Come on ride the train. Ride it!” You may combine a few keywords to create the chorus, “She’s smart, strong, and hot”, or “He’s brave, sensual, and strong.”Typically, the title of the song should also appear in the chorus.For example, if you use the chorus, “She’s smart, strong, and hot”, the song may be called “Smart, Strong, and Hot.”, Part of what makes a good chorus is setting up and paying off a rhyme. There are many ways to set up the rhyming structure of your chorus and there’s no right or wrong way to go about doing it. Your options for the rhyming structure are:Repeat the same line at least three times. If you choose to do this, make sure the line is fun to say or sing. For example, you may repeat the line, “I think you’re great” three times.When writing a four line chorus, rhyme the first line to the third line and the second line to the fourth line. For example, you may have the lines: “I think you’re great/We would be so good together/You’re the perfect mate/I think we could be forever.”Make the first and third lines the same and make the second and fourth lines the same. For example, you may have the lines: “I think you’re great/We would be so good together/You’re the perfect mate/I think we could be something special.”Make the first three lines the same, then diverge from the pattern for the fourth line. For example, you may have the lines: “I think you’re great/The perfect mate/I can’t wait/For us to be together.”Make all four lines completely different. For example, you may have the lines: “I think you’re great/We would be so good together/You’re my ideal/I want to date you.”, There are many different places a chorus can go within the confines of a song. Most people choose to alternate verses and choruses, but there is no hard and fast rule on this.Some songs repeat the chorus of the song over and over to help signify that the song is ending.If you choose to add a bridge, you’ll want to position an additional chorus after the bridge.  Your chorus will continue to reappear throughout the course of the song, so it’s important that the chorus be catchy enough that your crush will want to listen to it over and over again.Infuse the chorus with emotion to help show your crush how you really feel. You may talk about your feelings and emotions as well as the qualities that you appreciate in your crush.Another option is to write a chorus that sounds completely different from the rest of the verses. Try mixing up the rhythm or chord projections, changing keys or applying shifts in volume. If you know how, you can also add harmonies or instruments to enhance the chorus.  The verses will make up the majority of your song, so you want to use them to show your crush how you really feel about them. Brainstorm ideas by writing down your feelings, memories, or any moments you’ve spent with your crush that have made you happy.Read the writing out loud and look for keywords that stand out.Make a list of these words and use them as the foundation for your verse lyrics.  If you’ve ever written anything about your crush, you can use your previous writing in your song lyrics. Look back at old diary entries, texts, tweets or poems you’ve written to or about your crush.Try taking an individual line from something you’ve already written and building this into the verses of your song.You can also look at things your crush has written to or about you and mine those for inspiration.  Verses, like choruses, don’t always rhyme. If you want your verses to rhyme, check out a rhyming dictionary and look for places where you can change words to fit your rhyming pattern.Your words don’t always have to rhyme perfectly. Try using slant rhymes (like rhyming kiss and abyss).It’s better to have a song that doesn’t rhyme then to pick words that rhyme but don’t make sense in your song.  You are writing a love song for your crush only. You should try to make the lyrics specific to your crush, as this will make the song seem more genuine and heartfelt. Use personal experiences and details about your crush in the song.You may include inside jokes that you both share, such as a funny moment at work or at school. You may mention the inside joke in your lyrics to add a nice personal touch to the song.You may also mention specific details or traits that you admire or like about your crush. Try mentioning a specific moment when you noticed this trait or detail, such as the time your crush helped you solve a problem on the computer, showing you that they are sexy and computer savvy. Or the time your crush helped you move into your new apartment, a moment where you realized your crush was strong and supportive.  Love songs can become familiar and generic very fast, as there are too many cliches out there about love. A cliche is a phrase that has become so familiar it loses its meaning. You should avoid cliches in your love song so it feels specific to your crush and makes the emotional impact you are hoping for.For example, avoid familiar descriptions of love, like “my love is deep” or “my love is everlasting.” You should also avoid describing your feelings for your crush with cliche details, like “my heart cries for you” or “I want you so bad.”Instead, go for descriptions and details that feel unique and unfamiliar. Try describing your feelings for your crush in a funny and creative way, like “I like you more than cheese pizza and upside down cake” or “I think you’re cooler than anyone I know.” Make the lyrics fun and interesting so your crush gets drawn into your love song.  A bridge is used to break up a song – it’s a departure from the verses and chorus and can infuse a totally different feeling into a piece of music. Write lyrics for the bridge that are emotionally based and that heighten the feeling of love in your song.If you spend the entire song talking about how much you love your crush, use the bridge to describe the feeling you get when they’re not around.Build the energy throughout the bridge to help make your final chorus that much more powerful.  Since the bridge is meant to be a change from the rest of the song, you want to use the bridge’s melody to reflect that. Experiment with writing a new chord progression for the bridge.If the rest of the song is in a major key, switch to minor for the bridge.Borrow chord progressions from different keys for the bridge.Since the bridge is a heightening of the song, play around with setting the bridge in a higher key.End the bridge with an open chord or non-tonic chord.  Most songs are laid out like this: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus. Your song does not have to follow this format, but you can definitely use it as a template as you construct the order of your song.Some songs include third verses. If you have a third verse, position the third verse after the bridge, but before the last chorus.If you only have two verses, repeat the chorus twice after the bridge to capitalize on the energy built in the bridge section.","['Some people like to start their song by writing the lyrics, but if you’re not an experienced songwriter, it can be tricky to find a melody or track to fit those lyrics.', 'Look for a beat that you like, then write the rest of the song to fit that beat.', 'You should also consider using a slower beat if you are planning to write a love song that is sensual and sexy for your crush.', 'Pay close attention to the melody and rhythm of the track and try to fit your lyrics into what’s already there.', 'If your crush likes a certain genre of music, like pop or hip hop, you can also look for a backing track that falls within that genre.', ', If you play an instrument or are musically inclined, you may be able to write the melody for the song yourself.', 'Start by picking a simple chord progression, then build the melody for the song on top of that.', 'Try strumming or playing the chord progression while vocally improvising a melody.', 'Record your improvisation and listen to it back to see if there’s anything you want to keep.', 'Start with a basic chord progression, like D-E-A or Am-F-C-G.

Look your best without being too obvious about it. Pick the right time and place to do it. Tell your crush that you want to talk about something. Make your crush feel comfortable by laughing or making a joke. Spit it out. Wait for a reaction.,How to Tell Your Crush You Like Them2,"Sure, you should look good when you plan to tell your crush how you feel. Just don't dress up to the nines if you normally rock a casual look, or put on a brand-new outfit if you're always seen in cozy clothes. You don't want your crush to think that you're trying too hard to send them the right message. Just try looking a bit more dressed up and well groomed than you normally do -- this will boost your confidence when you share your feelings.  If you want to get the best results, then you have to pick a time when you and your crush can be fairly alone in a stress-free environment. You may not want to do it between classes, when your crush may be caught off guard or worried about the math test they have to take next period. Instead, pick a time when you know you can be alone, like after school, or at a group event when you know you can pull them away to chat for a while.  Don't make a big deal about it -- make it sound like you could be asking for help with your homework or something. Let your crush know that you wanted to talk about something in a one on one setting, but that there's not a lot of pressure to have a serious conversation. The more casual you can be without making it sound too casual, the better. Just say, ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something after school, do you have a minute?"", You shouldn't immediately spit out the words, ""I like you!"" because your crush may still be a little uncomfortable or confused about why you're alone. Instead, put them at ease by making a silly joke, poking fun at yourself, or laughing extra hard at something they say. Laughing will put your crush in a positive frame of mind, and it'll make them more receptive to whatever you want to say.  There's no need to delay. Once you're alone and have made your crush comfortable, you should just tell them how you feel. The sooner you do it, the better, and the less likely you'll be to make yourself more nervous or likely to ramble on about something unrelated. Just be simple and direct. Say, ""I wanted to tell you that I have a crush on you"" or ""I really like hanging out with you, and I want you to know that I have feelings for you.""When you tell your crush, look them in the eye and relax your body. Don't stand too close to them or look at the floor, or you'll look either too eager or too withdrawn.Use your crush's name when you tell them how you feel. ""Michael, there's something I want to tell you..."" sounds more personal than just saying, ""I want to tell you something.""Don't build up to the thing you have to say too much. This will only put pressure on yourself.  Don't immediately put pressure on your crush and say, ""So what do you think?"" It's likely that your crush is thrown off guard and needs some time to consider your words, whether they share your feelings or not. Take a few deep breaths, step back, and wait for your crush to respond.

Tell your crush how you feel over the phone. Tell your crush how you feel with a cute note. Ask them on a casual date. Know what not to do.,How to Tell Your Crush You Like Them3,"Though telling your crush in person will make you look more confident and mature, and saying it over the phone is sort of the worst way to do it, if you're really shy about telling your crush how you feel, then calling them and revealing your feelings is the next best bet. Just say hello, make them comfortable with a joke or casual comment, say, ""I wanted to tell you something,"" and then reveal your feelings.Talking over the phone will make you feel less nervous because you won't see your crush face to face. Still, if you're nervous, you can pace back and forth to get rid of some of that nervous energy.If you're determined to tell your crush how you feel over the phone, you can also practice by calling one of your friends and rehearsing what you'd say first.  Putting a cute note in your crush's locker, textbook, or backpack that tells them that you like them can be a nice way to tell them how you really feel. Just write something like, ""Hi, Mark, I just wanted to tell you that I like you."" Having your crush find the note at the right time can be a pleasant surprise -- just make sure the note will be easy to find.  If you're too nervous about saying, ""I like you,"" you can sidestep the situation by just asking your crush to hang out. You can simply say you have extra tickets to a movie or a show and invite your crush along, ask your crush if they're hungry or want to grab a snack or coffee somewhere, or ask if they want to go for a walk in the park. Asking them to hang out solo will make your feelings pretty obvious, so you can let your crush do more of the work when he figures it out.  There are a few things you should avoid doing if you want to tell your crush that you like them and get the best results. Here are some things you should avoid if you want to look confident and mature:Don't have your friends tell them how you feel. If you want to look mature, you have to do it yourself.Don't do it over Facebook. This will make you look like you're not serious or confident enough to have the conversation in person.Don't be too eager when you tell your crush how you feel. A simple ""I like you"" is far more effective and far less likely to scare them off than saying, ""I've been in love with you since the second grade...""","[""Though telling your crush in person will make you look more confident and mature, and saying it over the phone is sort of the worst way to do it, if you're really shy about telling your crush how you feel, then calling them and revealing your feelings is the next best bet."", 'Just say hello, make them comfortable with a joke or casual comment, say, ""I wanted to tell you something,"" and then reveal your feelings.', ""Talking over the phone will make you feel less nervous because you won't see your crush face to face."", ""Still, if you're nervous, you can pace back and forth to get rid of some of that nervous energy."", ""If you're determined to tell your crush how you feel over the phone, you can also practice by calling one of your friends and rehearsing what you'd say first."", ""Putting a cute note in your crush's locker, textbook, or backpack that tells them that you like them can be a nice way to tell them how you really feel."", 'Just write something like, ""Hi, Mark, I just wanted to tell you that I like you.""', 'Having your crush find the note at the right time can be a pleasant surprise -- just make sure the note will be easy to find.', 'If you\'re too nervous about saying, ""I like you,"" you can sidestep the situation by just asking your crush to hang out.', ""You can simply say you have extra tickets to a movie or a show and invite your crush along, ask your crush if they're hungry or want to grab a snack or coffee somewhere, or ask if they want to go for a walk in the park."", 'Asking them to hang out solo will make your feelings pretty obvious, so you can let your crush do more of the work when he figures it out.', 'There are a few things you should avoid doing if you want to tell your crush that you like them and get the best results.', 'Here are some things you should avoid if you want to look confident and mature:', ""Don't have your friends tell them how you feel."", 'If you want to look mature, you have to do it yourself.', ""Don't do it over Facebook."", ""This will make you look like you're not serious or confident enough to have the conversation in person."", ""Don't be too eager when you tell your crush how you feel."", 'A simple ""I like you"" is far more effective and far less likely to scare them off than saying, ""I\'ve been in love with you since the second grade...""']"

Do they cross their legs towards you and keep their shoulders pointed at you at the same time? Do they try to appear good-looking?

Small things like this often can mean more than what it seems.Another good sign is if you notice them hanging around you even though you're not having a conversation with them.Looking straight into your eyes (although they may be a little nervous doing so) means they're paying attention to you. If you feel like they are looking deep into your eyes, that could also be a sign.Most of the time, if a crush likes you, they'll jump at the opportunity to help you. Even with small things, they'll always be there to help out with your problems (especially if you ask).Do they sometimes show off and tell jokes around you to make you laugh?

Whether or not it's conscious, someone who likes you (more often girls) will generally find excuses to touch you.They might put their hand on your shoulder, or accidentally walk into you in the halls, or wipe something random off your face.Do they tickle you or tease with their hands? Do they ask you for piggybacks, or throw random things at you in an effort to get your attention?Even gestures that don't seem playful or nice might mean they're attracted to you.

It might mean that they want attention from you, and they're trying to get it without telegraphing their true feelings.  Do you ever see them looking at you when they think you cannot see them? If you catch him/her looking at you and you look back, do they look away? If they do, that could be a sign of nervousness.On the other hand, do they always avoid looking at you, no matter what? Not looking at someone might mean they're trying to keep their crush secret and don't want you to know.Get a trusted friend to look at them during class or at recess; have the friend see whether your crush looks at you, and for how long.

Wait for your crush's response.,How to Tell Your Crush How You Really Feel,"It'll only be embarrassing for both of you if others are around and even more so if your crush rejects you. You could have a friend waiting in the wings to give you courage and be there for you afterward but don't have this person anywhere near you and your crush when you decide to talk.Wait for a time when you're not in a group or surrounded by others.Be sure things won't be rushed. Don't leave it till the bell is about to ring. , Don't do the whole ""I have something terribly serious"" routine. It is an immediate giveaway and also suggests that you are a bit clingy or dramatic, which could frighten off your prospective date. Instead, find the right moment and just say: ""Can we have a chat... alone?"" and suggest that you sit somewhere pleasant.Ensure that the spot is comfortable and sufficiently private before talking.  If you're at the point of explaining your feelings, it'll mean you've already done the soul searching and deep thinking. Now is the time for action. Be confident and start with some small talk to ease yourself into the situation, asking how school is, what the weekend's plans are, etc.  There is no one single right way to explain it, that's up to you and how you'd like to express it. The main thing is to get to the point, to keep it simple and to avoid gushing. Here are some possible ways to open up:""I have a crush on you. I was just wondering if you feel the same way, do you? If you don't I will completely understand"".""I like you. I'd love to go on a date with you some time soon.""""We've been hanging out together for a long time now. My feelings for you are deeper than friendship and I wanted to tell you I've been crushing on you for a while now. I hope you feel the same way too."", He or she will either be receptive to your admission or a little taken aback. If they are of the same mind and tell you so, be happy and suggest the chance for a date. If not, well, at least you've expressed yourself and know the reality of the situation. However, give things some time; remember that your crush may be someone who needs time to digest things. Here are some suggested replies:If he/she says yes, be happy and give them a hug. Say: ""Thanks for letting me know you feel the same way too. It'll be much easier not having to keep my feelings to myself!"" And you can suggest a first date.If he/she says no, be polite and kind. Say ""Oh, that's okay, I understand. We have different feelings and that's okay, I just wanted to let you know what I felt. I'm sorry if I've surprised you, it'll all be okay."" Then suggest you stay good friends and let things be as they've always been. Head off to find your friend for moral support.If you do get rejected, be polite enough to never speak of it again. Rejection is part of life, gossiping about or maligning the other person doesn't make it any better. Just let it go; there is someone else out there for you.","[""It'll only be embarrassing for both of you if others are around and even more so if your crush rejects you."", ""You could have a friend waiting in the wings to give you courage and be there for you afterward but don't have this person anywhere near you and your crush when you decide to talk."", ""Wait for a time when you're not in a group or surrounded by others."", ""Be sure things won't be rushed."", ""Don't leave it till the bell is about to ring."", ', Don\'t do the whole ""I have something terribly serious"" routine.', 'It is an immediate giveaway and also suggests that you are a bit clingy or dramatic, which could frighten off your prospective date.', 'Instead, find the right moment and just say: ""Can we have a chat... alone?"" and suggest that you sit somewhere pleasant.', 'Ensure that the spot is comfortable and sufficiently private before talking.', ""If you're at the point of explaining your feelings, it'll mean you've already done the soul searching and deep thinking."", 'Now is the time for action.', ""Be confident and start with some small talk to ease yourself into the situation, asking how school is, what the weekend's plans are, etc."", ""There is no one single right way to explain it, that's up to you and how you'd like to express it."", 'The main thing is to get to the point, to keep it simple and to avoid gushing.', 'Here are some possible ways to open up:""I have a crush on you.', 'I was just wondering if you feel the same way, do you?', 'If you don\'t I will completely understand"".', '""I', 'like you.', ""I'd love to go on a date with you some time soon."", '""""We\'ve been hanging out together for a long time now.', ""My feelings for you are deeper than friendship and I wanted to tell you I've been crushing on you for a while now."", 'I hope you feel the same way too."", He or she will either be receptive to your admission or a little taken aback.', 'If they are of the same mind and tell you so, be happy and suggest the chance for a date.', ""If not, well, at least you've expressed yourself and know the reality of the situation."", 'However, give things some time; remember that your crush may be someone who needs time to digest things.', 'Here are some suggested replies:If he/she says yes, be happy and give them a hug.', 'Say: ""Thanks for letting me know you feel the same way too.', 'It\'ll be much easier not having to keep my feelings to myself!""', 'And you can suggest a first date.', 'If he/she says no, be polite and kind.', 'Say ""Oh, that\'s okay, I understand.', ""We have different feelings and that's okay,"", 'I just wanted to let you know what I felt.', 'I\'m sorry if I\'ve surprised you, it\'ll all be okay.""', ""Then suggest you stay good friends and let things be as they've always been."", 'Head off to find your friend for moral support.', 'If you do get rejected, be polite enough to never speak of it again.', ""Rejection is part of life, gossiping about or maligning the other person doesn't make it any better."", 'Just let it go; there is someone else out there for you.']"
"Figure out your own feelings first.It's important to first ask yourself whether your feelings are really strong enough to warrant taking things to the next level. Consider your chances. Find out if your crush is already interested in somebody else. Check your crush for signs of attraction.Signs of attraction, whether conscious or unconscious, will usually shine through in a given interaction, even if it's just a friendship on the surface level so far. Make sure there are no outstanding issues in your current friendship. Make sure your lives are relatively stable. Dress your best. Use confident body language.Confident body language is a positive vicious cycle. Make a list of reasons why you would be great for your crush. Stay calm and upbeat. Ask your crush to meet up with you. Hang out casually. Make eye contact.Exhibiting all forms of positive, confident body language is an important trick when it comes to attracting someone, but nothing's quite as important as holding eye contact while you admit romantic feelings to your crush. Tell your crush how you feel. Express your feelings non-verbally. Express your intentions. Let your crush respond. Work damage control, if necessary.",How to Tell Someone You Have Feelings for Them,"There are many different levels and types of attraction. In some cases, your feelings may not be strong enough to warrant moving forward with them; in other situations it's better to wait a while and see. If you feel you really want to admit your feelings however, you owe it to yourself to follow through with it. , It's probably not the sort of thing you want to be thinking about realistically when you first become attracted to someone, but it is nonetheless important to consider just how likely your crush is to return your feelings. Has he shown you any signs of attraction beyond friendship, or has he turned you away whenever things have gotten personal?Weighing the risk of telling your feelings is important if you don't want to risk the friendship.You can do more harm than good by letting a friend know your real feelings, especially if the whole thing is approached incorrectly.  Finding out about your crush's other potential interests is an important part of weighing your own chances. Letting someone know you have feelings for him is a big risk, especially if you really value the existing relationship you share together. With that in mind, it's a good idea to make sure someone hasn't beaten you to the chase before going in yourself. Even if someone might be interested in you otherwise, there's very little chance he'll strike up a relationship if he's actively pursuing someone else at the time.Note the difference between real interest and passing attraction. If your friend has called a member of the opposite sex 'good-looking' or even 'hot', that doesn't necessarily mean he's wanting to date them. On the contrary, he may even be testing you to see if you'll react when he says something like that.  If your crush likes you, chances are you'll be able to sense it on some level. Does he go out of his way to shower you with attention and compliments? If your crush is a girl, does she avert her gaze a lot when she's around you, or laugh and smile more than usual when you're talking to her?Not only will sensing mutual attraction give you a better idea of what your potential chances are, knowing the attraction is there will make you feel more confident when it comes time to admit your feelings.  Even if the two of you are both attracted to one another, admitting attraction is bringing new business into your relationship, and it should be avoided for the time being if you still have current issues to attend to.If you had a recent fight as friends, it would be a good idea to hold off on admitting your feelings until the dust has settled and you've resolved your current differences. If you're starting a relationship together, you want to get it started off on the right foot.  Could you imagine someone admitting they have a crush on you if you were in the middle of going through a family tragedy? Even if you had feelings in return for that person, you wouldn't be able to deal with it at the time. Knowing when to strike is a key part of making the approach work.  'Dressing up' doesn't have to mean getting glamorous or ritzy. What it does mean, however, is that you should put slightly more effort into your appearance than you usually do.This isn't so much for your crush's benefit as for your own. We always feel our most confident when we're looking our best. If this means taking an extra few minutes to soak up steam in the shower, or wearing your favourite shirt, then so be it. In the end, you want to do everything you can to set your mind at rest.Although confidence-boosting is the biggest reason why you should try to look good, it goes without saying that your crush is all that more likely to accept you if you put some added effort into your appearance!, While it goes to show other people that you're feeling confident, using body language like good posture, eye contact and smiling will serve to make you feel even more confident. Even before you meet up with your crush, you should try making a habit of expressing confident body language. You should notice a firm change in the way you feel before too long.  A relationship is a two-way street, and both sides need to be getting something out of it. That means you should have a good idea what you'll be bringing into a relationship if it works out in your favour. Start by making a list of things you love most about yourself. Which of these things would benefit a relationship? Do you love your smile? Your crush probably does too. Do you like to laugh? Are you really clever or funny? Now's not the time to be modest!Reflect upon this list and try to imagine how happy you could make the other person. If you know you have a lot to offer, you'll feel more confident when it comes time to admit your feelings.If you need any help thinking up things, you should try talking to a friend (who isn't your crush) about what things most stand out about you.  The worst injury anyone can cause their chances of starting a relationship with their crush is by doubting themselves. When you self-doubt, it shows in the way you act and carry yourself. You won't be able to act casual if you're worried about 'what-if' situations as you close in.Taking a deep breath is a helpful way to calm your nerves if they're acting up on you. It will take the edge off the stress, and give you a respite from the physical anxiety.Positive self-talk works as well. For example, try thinking something along these lines to yourself: ""I have nothing to fear. I am worth my crush's time. Everything's going to work out just the way I want it."" Keep telling yourself that until you start believing it. Whether you think it's plausible or not, positive self-talk tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the confidence you'll gain from it will have a major impact on how the interaction plays out.  It's becoming more and more common for people to confess their crushes online, or via text message. Talking through a screen will work in a pinch, but it robs the conversation of its full importance. Because so many of the signs of attraction come across through body language, you'll stifle your chances by keeping it online.Ask your crush out by saying something like ""Hey-- I was thinking of going to the beach sometime this weekend. Would you be interested in coming with?""Keep it casual; admitting your feelings doesn't have to be the main point of hanging out with them. If you enjoy their company enough, it won't feel out of place to get together.  A big mistake many people make when it comes to approaching their crushes is that they put too much weight on the act. If the experience of being around you is extremely serious and sombre, your crush isn't exactly going to be open to starting a relationship with you, even if he's already attracted to you.A casual hangout could be anything from going to the mall or rock concert, to something quieter like the park or beach. Activities that limit interaction like a movie aren't as well suited for something like this, as it won't give you near as much opportunity to confess your feelings.Going to dinner is a very common type of casual hangout. If you go for food, the type of restaurant you go to will help decide the type of atmosphere. Something ritzy and formal may be inauthentic if you're not used to going to fancy restaurants. Go somewhere the two of you will feel comfortable and relaxed.  Eye contact is a way of making the emotions feel real; a lot of unconscious communication goes on with eye contact. Suffice to say, holding your crush's gaze while you admit your feelings will keep him focused on what you're saying.Make a point of holding eye contact when your crush is speaking to you. Hold your crush's gaze while you admit your feelings. It may be appropriate to look away after you have confessed and are waiting for a response. Averting your gaze may help your crush to relax while he prepares a response.  Wait until you feel very comfortable with your crush to let him know how you feel.This is the point you've been waiting for, at it's probably pretty likely you're feeling frazzled at the thought of it. But worry not-- actually telling your crush is in itself a fairly simple action. With solid eye contact in place, tell your crush how you feel. Express it in simple terms, so that there's no room for interpretation. If you try to dress it up, you'll only distract from the point you're trying to make. Stay confident, and treat the experience like a positive thing.You can list some reasons why you like them as well if you'd like. Use the following as an example: ""You know, I don't know if it's already totally obvious, but I really like you. In a way that's more than a friend. I hope you feel the same way about me too."", One method that tends to work fairly well is actually not to say anything at all. Instead, expressing your feelings non-verbally can say as much as any number of words. While a non-verbal expression will usually be followed by some confirmation that you do have real feelings for this person, letting your feelings through in a more subtle way can be a perfect way to break the ice.Physical touching is risky if your existing relationship has never included it, but it's much more likely to succeed if you go into it with confidence in yourself. Something as light as reaching for their hand, or more bold like a direct kiss, will leave little room for interpretation that you're interested.Giving a gift also works, especially if you're a male in pursuit of a female. Gift-giving is often seen as chivalrous, and definitely pushes past the boundaries of 'just friends' provided the gift is special enough. Buying flowers is a good place to start if you can't think of something more specific, but it's always best to pick out a gift that really relates to the specific connection and experiences you've shared together.Non-verbal ways of expressing your feelings are always best accompanied with some sort of verbal affirmation. Don't just take her hand or give her a gift; let her know exactly why you've done that, and make it clear the ball's now in her court.  Now that you've made your feelings known to your crush, it's time to go into a bit more detail as to where you'd like your relationship to go. Simply telling someone you're attracted to him isn't an end unto itself; if you see it going anywhere, you should arrange plans to see one another on a more regular, romantic basis, provided that's what you're looking for. Be specific about what you want.You might try formally asking your crush on a first date. Try saying something like ""If you agree that there's something special between us, maybe you'd be interested in going out with me sometime? It would be great to get a chance to get to know each other on a deeper level.""Gauging by the reaction of your crush as you told him your feelings, you should have a better idea whether things are going to work out.  The anticipation and nerve-wracking nature of admitting your feelings to someone is rarely about how you're going to do it, but the ways in which you think the other person might react. If you've admitted your feelings and possibly expressed clear intentions, the other person is bound to have some sort of response in store for you. Whether it's a positive or negative one will depend on the success of your advance, and the feelings they've had (or haven't had) for you all along. All the same, it is necessary you give your crush some time to properly respond to you.Stay calm throughout. Even in the worst reactions, it's better to keep a brave face and remain strong rather than let your emotions get the best of you. Breaking down into tears was never a good look on anyone.  If you get news you don't want to hear, it's important to remember that it's not the end of the world. As hard as it is to believe at the time, you'll feel much better about it as times goes on, and possibly even realize that you were better off without taking things to the next level. Even so, doing some damage control is often the best next step. Let your crush know that you care about him as a friend still, and you don't want to lose the friendship. Take some time to yourself if you feel you need to heal.Remind your crush that you care about him on multiple levels and aren't purely trying to get a relationship out of him.For example, you can say: ""I know this might change things for us, but I want you to know I really value having you as a friend, and I don't want to lose you, even if you don't feel the same way about me.""","['There are many

Notice how he talks to you. Notice what he talks about. See how he talks about other girls.,How to Tell if He Likes You1,"The way he talks to you can say a lot about his real feelings for you. The next time you hang out, pay attention to his tone and the level of attention he gives you when you speak. Here are some ways to see if he likes you just based on how you talk to each other:See if he makes eye contact. Is he giving you his full attention, or looking around the room for something better to do? Is he breaking eye contact occasionally but smiling because he feels shy around you?See if he's giving you his full attention when he talks to you. Is he checking his phone and stopping to talk to other people? If so, then he may not be trying to impress you. But if he talks to you like you're the only person in the world, then he may have a big crush on you.See if he tries to impress you. Does he tell stories that make him look strong, funny, or adventurous? If so, then he probably wants to catch your eye.See if he talks more softly when he’s around you. This may be his way of telling you to lean in to get closer. , If the guy has you firmly planted in his friend zone, then he'll talk to you differently than he would if he was trying to impress you and make you see him as more than a friend. You should pay attention not only to how he talks to you, but to what he chooses to talk about.See if he reveals personal information. If he's opening up to you about trouble with his friends or family, then he values your opinion and likes you. But if he's opening up to you about a new girl he likes, then you may have a problem.See if he mentions his childhood. This is pretty private for most guys, and if he opens up about it, then he’s definitely trying to get closer to you.See if he compliments you. If he tells you that you look nice, or finds subtle ways to let you know you're interesting or funny, then he may be falling for you.See if he teases you. If he feels comfortable enough around you to tease you, then he might like you.See if he tries to be more refined around you. If you notice him burping, cursing, and being generally a little bit gross around his bros, but find him never cursing and speaking in a measured and polite way around you, then he's trying to impress you.  If he talks to you about other girls, it'll be for one of two reasons. Either he likes you and wants to make you jealous, or he just sees you as a friend and wants your advice. Here's how to find out what it means when he tells you about other ladies:If he's always complaining about women he's dating or says, ""None of them are what I'm looking for,"" then he may be hinting that you're the one.If he always asks you for romantic advice no matter who he's dating, then he may see you as a friend. If he says that you give the best advice, he may not be looking at you as more than a friend.If he's always talking about his latest conquest but not asking for advice, he could just be showing off to win you over. But be careful - you don't want to end up being just another number in his little black book.If he ever compares a girl to you unfavorably by saying something like, “She’s cool, but she’s not nearly as funny as you,” then he’s telling you he’d rather be dating you instead.","['The way he talks to you can say a lot about his real feelings for you.', 'The next time you hang out, pay attention to his tone and the level of attention he gives you when you speak.', 'Here are some ways to see if he likes you just based on how you talk to each other:', 'See if he makes eye contact.', 'Is he giving you his full attention, or looking around the room for something better to do?', 'Is he breaking eye contact occasionally but smiling because he feels shy around', 'you?See', ""if he's giving you his full attention when he talks to you."", 'Is he checking his phone and stopping to talk to other people?', 'If so, then he may not be trying to impress you.', ""But if he talks to you like you're the only person in the world, then he may have a big crush on you."", 'See if he tries to impress you.', 'Does he tell stories that make him look strong, funny, or adventurous?', 'If so, then he probably wants to catch your eye.', 'See if he talks more softly when he’s around you.', 'This may be his way of telling you to lean in to get closer.', "", If the guy has you firmly planted in his friend zone, then he'll talk to you differently than he would if he was trying to impress you and make you see him as more than a friend."", 'You should pay attention not only to how he talks to you, but to what he chooses to talk about.', 'See if he reveals personal information.', ""If he's opening up to you about trouble with his friends or family, then he values your opinion and likes you."", ""But if he's opening up to you about a new girl he likes, then you may have a problem."", 'See if he mentions his childhood.', 'This is pretty private for most guys, and if he opens up about it, then he’s definitely trying to get closer to you.', 'See if he compliments you.', ""If he tells you that you look nice, or finds subtle ways to let you know you're interesting or funny, then he may be falling for you."", 'See if he teases you.', 'If he feels comfortable enough around you to tease you, then he might like you.', 'See if he tries to be more refined around you.', ""If you notice him burping, cursing, and being generally a little bit gross around his bros, but find him never cursing and speaking in a measured and polite way around you, then he's trying to impress you."", ""If he talks to you about other girls, it'll be for one of two reasons."", 'Either he likes you and wants to make you jealous, or he just sees you as a friend and wants your advice.', 'Here\'s how to find out what it means when he tells you about other ladies:If he\'s always complaining about women he\'s dating or says, ""None of them are what I\'m looking for,"" then he may be hinting that you\'re the one.', ""If he always asks you for romantic advice no matter who he's dating, then he may see you as a friend."", 'If he says that you give the best advice, he may not be looking at you as more than a friend.', ""If he's always talking about his latest conquest but not asking for advice, he could just be showing off to win you over."", ""But be careful - you don't want to end up being just another number in his little black book."", 'If he ever compares a girl to you unfavorably by saying something like, “She’s cool, but she’s not nearly as funny as you,” then he’s telling you he’d rather be dating you instead.']"

"You hang out most often, just the two of you. You see each other every day. Your hangouts are getting more intimate. You have lots of physical contact. You're receiving gifts. There's lots of flirting. You don't have any conversational limits. Your friend acts nervous around you. Your friend seems to dress up around you. Your friend gets jealous. You like your friend. Decide how you feel. Just ask. Ask your mutual friends for advice. Tell them how you feel. Spend some time apart, if you're uncomfortable.",How to Tell if Your Friend Likes You,"Almost all friends hang out, and often it'll just be one-on-one. If your friend has been suggesting lots of one-on-one hangouts, that's extremely common for both close friends and for flirty romances, and not necessarily a sign of a romance. But, if you've noticed that it's happening a lot lately, or more than usual, it might be a sign your friend likes you.If your friend doesn't want to hang out with other people when you're hanging out together, that could definitely be a sign. , You might see your friends often, but if you feel the need to check in with this person all the time, every single day, there might be a lot more there than a regular old friendship. Does your day feel incomplete if you don't talk to your friend? Do you miss your friend, even if you're just apart for the after-school period of the day?Keep in mind texting as well. If you're regularly having never-ending text conversations, we're talking hundreds of messages a day, then you might like each other.  Going for coffee, just the two of you? Going to dinner, or for long walks in the evenings? Are they going out of their way to invite you to something you love, but they don't care much about? That's a sure sign that your friend is showing you that you matter to them, a lot. Maybe they like you more than a friend.  If your friend likes you, they may start touching you more. While some people are naturally ""hands-on,"" an increase in physical contact is almost always a sign of romantic interest. You may find that they're doing it to test your boundaries, like dipping your toe in the water to find out how cold it is. If you notice that it's happening quite frequently, it's a big sign.If the contact makes you uncomfortable, then say something about it. It's never ok to touch someone inappropriately and out of the blue if you're not interested.  If they are giving you very personal gifts, such as poems, songs, or things that you specifically like, your friend may be trying to get a message across in big bold letters: I Like You.Personal gifts and hand-made items are usually signs of romantic interest. Mix CDs? Huge sign of a crush.  Some people are just naturally flirty. The barista, the server, the bus driver might all be flirted with in the course of a day for the naturally flirtatious. Of course, you may find that your platonic relationship has suddenly turned flirty on a regular basis, where it wasn't before. They may not be so subtle or shy about their crush on you.If your friend is paying you a lot of compliments, or making cheeky little flirty comments, it's a safe bet that they like you and are interested.  If your friend tells you everything–like, everything–then it's a pretty good sign that you've got a more-than-friends relationship. You might talk to friends about school, and your sports team, and other normal stuff. But if you're regularly talking to someone about your dreams, your hopes, your fears, and your deepest kind of stuff? That might be a sign that there's more going on there.Having deep conversations is also something that happens between very close friends. If you're just having good conversations but don't notice any other signs, it's not necessarily a sign of anything more.  If you're just friends with someone, there's not usually any reason to feel nervous about anything. If your friend seems to be suddenly anxious to be around you, that could be a sign that you're becoming more than a friend to them. Try to pay attention to their body language and their level of nervousness.  Does your friend seem to be making an extra effort at looking good in your presence? If you made plans to walk around the mall, but your friend looks like they're done up for a date, it might be because they think they're going on one.Pay especially close attention to things like hair product, make-up, and fancy clothes. If your friend is putting in the extra effort, you'll notice.  Try bringing up a current crush that you've got. Even if you have to make it up, bring up the concept of dating someone else and see how your friend reacts. If they like you, they may get jealous, or become kind of down. They may make fun of the person you say you've got a crush on. This is all a sign that they're interested.Ask your friend about their current crushes. If they get embarrassed or don't want to talk about it, it might be because their crush is sitting in your chair.  If you're wondering whether or not your friend likes you more than a friend, it might be because you're feeling those feelings yourself. But it can be hard to tell the difference sometimes. What's the difference between wanting to hang out with someone a lot and wanting to be ""more""? Maybe nothing! All relationships move at different paces, and it can be hard to tell.Do you think about your friend more your other crushes or love interests? If so, you might be having deeper feedings.Are you attracted to your friend physically? If so, you might like them, but you also might like them even if you never really noticed them before. You might like what you've gotten to know on the inside.  If you've noticed some signs that your friend might have a crush on you, it's important to give some thought to the way that you feel before you do anything about it. Decide what you'll do for either outcome, before you actually do anything.Assume the answer is ""yes,"" and that your friend likes you. Do you feel the same way? Would you like your friendship to be more than just a friendship?Assume the answer is ""no,"" and that your friend doesn't like you. Might bringing it up make your friend uncomfortable? If you do like your friend and would like to be more, do you think talking about it might harm the friendship you do have.  The best and fastest way to find out if your friend likes you is to just ask. If you've noticed more than a couple of the signs listed in the previous section, there's a good chance that your friend might like you. Sit them down, say, ""We've been spending a lot of time together. I just noticed and I started wondering – Do you like me? Do you want to be more than friends?""Even if they don't like you, if your friend is a true and caring friend, they won't be offended if you ask, or if you talk about whether or not you want to be more than ""just"" friends.If you think your friendship might suffer, and you're not interested in being a couple, then you might consider not asking. Don't worry about whether or not they like you and just continue being friends.  If you've noticed some signs of attraction, but you're just not sure, then ask around. Talk to a trusted mutual friend who knows both of you equally. Say something gentle and kind, like, ""I've noticed that ___ seems to be paying a lot of attention to me lately. Do you think there's something there?""Asking around doesn't mean ""spreading rumors."" Don't tell people that your friend likes you if you haven't talked to them first.  If you suspect they do like you, and you like them back, then tell them. Take a chance! You never know where it could take you. And if you don't like them, and they are making you uncomfortable, it's also important to tell them. You don't deserve to feel uncomfortable, and your friend probably doesn't want you to feel uncomfortable either.Even if you don't like them back, it can be good to clear the air and be honest with one another. If you're made uncomfortable by your friend's advances, it might be important to spend some time apart for a while.  If your friend does like you and you don't, or vice versa, it might make it hard to keep hanging out like you have been. It's sad to think that your friendship might suffer, but in some cases, it's important to spend a little time apart so you can stay friends in the long-term.In some cases, if your feelings are strong enough, it might be hard to stay friends like you used to be, if you feel differently about each other. You may find yourselves naturally moving apart from each other. That's ok. It's a big part of growing up.","[""Almost all friends hang out, and often it'll just be one-on-one."", ""If your friend has been suggesting lots of one-on-one hangouts, that's extremely common for

Notice his body language. Pay attention to the things he does for you. Study him in action with other girls. See if he’s always trying to hang out with you. Analyze your hang-out sessions. See if he flirts with you.,How to Tell if He Likes You2,"His body language can be a big factor in showing you if he wants to get closer to you, or if he just sees you as a buddy. If he puts his arm around you, you need to know it's because he likes you, not because he's just palling around. Here are some ways to see if his body language means he likes you as more than a friend:Notice how he sits next to you. Does he always try to move closer until your knees touch, or is he sitting miles away?Try to see if you can catch him stealing a glance in your direction. If you catch his eye and he even blushes and looks away, then he knows he's been caught!See if he's always looking for excuses to touch you. Does he get physical if you're playing a friendly game of volleyball or soccer, and does he always ask you to be his partner when it's time for chicken fights in the pool?See if his body is directed towards you when you speak. Does he stand with his body towards you and his arms gesturing or at his sides? If so, then he wants to give you all of his attention.See how he touches other girls. Does he put his arm around every girl, or only you?See if he ever gently pats your hand, even when he’s joking. This is a very intimate gesture, and it may show that he really likes you.  He may just be a really good friend, or all of those favors he's doing for you may mean something more. Notice all of the things he does for you and think about what they mean. Here's how to tell:See if he's being very thoughtful. Does he bring you coffee when you're having an intense study session, or get tickets for a movie you hinted that you want to see? If so, then he's probably hanging on to your every word and just wants to make you happy.See if he does nice things for everyone. Is he just ""Mr. Nice Guy"" and loves giving rides and buying lunch for everyone in town, or does he do these things for only you? Remember, if he likes you, then he'll treat you differently than everybody else.If he helps you out with your chores, like doing your laundry, then he definitely wants to be your boyfriend.If he offers to help you with your car, he's not just being friendly - he wants you to be impressed by his manliness.  You need to check out how he talks to other girls to see if he treats them just like he treats you, or if he thinks you're special to him. You don't have to stare or stalk to get a sense of how he treats others and to have a sense of where you stand with him.See if he's a perpetual flirt. Does he flirt with every girl in the room, or only you? Remember, he may still like you if he flirts with other girls, but it makes it less likely that he's singling you out.You can also look for the opposite sign. Does he flirt with every girl except for you? Then maybe he’s not flirting with you because you’re the only one he really likes. He may respect you too much to tease or flirt with you like he does with every other girl.Does he seem embarrassed or shy if he hangs out with a new girlfriend in front of you? If so, then he may not want you to see his relationship unfolding because he’d rather be with you.See if the other girls he hangs out with know who you are. If he’s with another girl and she gives you an, “Oh, I’ve heard about you” look, then the girl may be jealous because you’re important to the guy.  If he likes you, then he’ll want to be around you as much as possible. He could try to do this in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Here are a few signs that he wants to be around you because he sees you as more than a friend:If he acts like you’re the only person in the room when you’re hanging out in big groups. If you’re at a party, concert, or a bar, and you realize you ended up talking to him for most of the night, then he definitely wants to get closer to you.If you have a class together and he always tries to sit next to you and even saves you a seat, then he may want to take things to the next level.Notice if he sometimes just happens to run into you in your favorite coffee shop or bar. If he’s always around, then he may have a stalking problem, but if he’s just “in the area” occasionally, then it may be because he’s hoping to run into you.  Paying attention to how and how often you hang out and to when and where you hang out can give you great insight into whether he just wants to see you ask a friend or if he wants all of your hang-sessions to be more like dates. Here are some points to consider:Notice where you hang out. Do you see him in romantic locations like gardens, nicer wine bars, or places where you see couples hanging out for date nights? If so, then he may want the same for you.Notice who is around when you hang out. If it’s always just the two of you, then he may see you as crush material. But if he’s always inviting ten of his closest bros along, then he may see you just as another friend.Notice when you hang out. If you only see him once a month, then he may not be trying to spend more time with you. But if it feels like you haven’t gone more than a day without seeing him recently, then yeah, he probably likes you.Notice what you do when you hang out. Going out for coffee or a quick lunch is more meant for the friend zone, but going out for dinner or seeing a movie in the evening is a more-than-friend activity.  This may feel like a no brainer, but it may be harder to tell if he’s flirting with you than you think. Every guy has his own flirting style, and there will be a variety of ways to flirt with you to show that he definitely likes you.

"Ask your friends what they think. If you’re feeling bold, ask his friends. Ask him yourself.",How to Tell if He Likes You3,"If you have some close friends who are always hanging around you two, then you may be able to ask them if they think he really likes you. You may be too blinded by Cupid’s arrow to be able to see the situation clearly, but one of your friends may have more insight.Ask a friend you trust who already knows the situation well. If she’s seen you hang out a bunch of times, she should have an opinion.Ask a friend to study the two of you next time you’re together and to report back. Just make sure the friend isn’t being too obvious.Pick a friend whose opinion and judgment you value. Pick someone with good social sense to get the best answer.Tell your friends to be honest. If they really don’t think he likes you, or even know that he likes someone else, then you should benefit from the truth.  This is a very dangerous step. There are few boys who would break “bro code” and not run and report your question back to your crush. But if you don’t know who else to ask or if you really trust one of his friends, then casually ask how he feels about you.Though this is a riskier step, his friends will have a better answer than your friends, since they have first-hand information from your guy.Ask his friend if he likes you could also just be a sneaky way to let him know how you feel. If you’re too scared to tell him yourself, this information will get back to him ASAP if you tell the wrong person.  Once you’re feeling fairly confident that the guy likes you and are tired of waiting around and reading the signs, it may be time to just tell him how you feel and ask if he feels the same way. He could be really shy and may be relieved that you’re taking the initiative. Here’s how to ask him if he really likes you:Find some time to be alone with him. Make sure you don’t ask him when his friends are looking over your shoulder.Be honest and open. Just say you have a crush on him and want to know if he shares your feelings. Before he responds, let him know that it’s no big deal if he doesn’t like you.You should only do this if you’re pretty sure that he likes you. If he has exhibited multiple signs of liking you, then be bold and ask him. If he has shown no signs of liking you, then it may be time to wait to see what happens.","['If you have some close friends who are always hanging around you two, then you may be able to ask them if they think he really likes you.', 'You may be too blinded by Cupid’s arrow to be able to see the situation clearly, but one of your friends may have more insight.', 'Ask a friend you trust who already knows the situation well.', 'If she’s seen you hang out a bunch of times, she should have an opinion.', 'Ask a friend to study the two of you next time you’re together and to report back.', 'Just make sure the friend isn’t being too obvious.', 'Pick a friend whose opinion and judgment you value.', 'Pick someone with good social sense to get the best answer.', 'Tell your friends to be honest.', 'If they really don’t think he likes you, or even know that he likes someone else, then you should benefit from the truth.', 'This is a very dangerous step.', 'There are few boys who would break “bro code” and not run and report your question back to your crush.', 'But if you don’t know who else to ask or if you really trust one of his friends, then casually ask how he feels about you.', 'Though this is a riskier step, his friends will have a better answer than your friends, since they have first-hand information from your guy.', 'Ask his friend if he likes you could also just be a sneaky way to let him know how you feel.', 'If you’re too scared to tell him yourself, this information will get back to him ASAP if you tell the wrong person.', 'Once you’re feeling fairly confident that the guy likes you and are tired of waiting around and reading the signs, it may be time to just tell him how you feel and ask if he feels the same way.', 'He could be really shy and may be relieved that you’re taking the initiative.', 'Here’s how to ask him if he really likes you:Find some time to be alone with him.', 'Make sure you don’t ask him when his friends are looking over your shoulder.', 'Be honest and open.', 'Just say you have a crush on him and want to know if he shares your feelings.', 'Before he responds, let him know that it’s no big deal if he doesn’t like you.', 'You should only do this if you’re pretty sure that he likes you.', 'If he has exhibited multiple signs of liking you, then be bold and ask him.', 'If he has shown no signs of liking you, then it may be time to wait to see what happens.']"

Tell him you need time for yourself.,How to Tell If a Guy Cares1,"Allow him to make plans for getting together. Note how much of his free time he devotes to you. The more time he wants to spend with you, the more he cares.Allow some leeway if your schedules are busy or conflicting because of work, school, or family functions. But if he has all the free time in the world and only wants to see you once a week, consider that a sign of ambivalence. , Note how frequently he calls, emails, or texts you. If he contacts you regularly, consider that a sign that he wants to be part of your life. Give him a little grace period if he’s extremely busy, but also note how much effort he makes to keep in touch in spite of that.On the other hand, watch out if he's calling way too much. If he calls you when he knows you're busy with work, family, or studying and still expects you to drop everything and talk to him, that probably means he cares less about your needs and more about his own.  When you aren’t going to see each other anytime soon, ask him what he’ll be up to. Gauge his willingness to answer. If he seems cagey and vague, consider that a sign that he doesn’t care enough about you to share all of his life with you. If he’s forthcoming and lets you know what his plans are at any given hour, take it as a sign of honesty and inclusion.Take him at his word when he tells you what he'll be up to.

If he does care about you and catches you stalking him, he might take that as a sign of mistrust, which could hurt your relationship.

If he respects the fact that everyone needs a little break from each other from time to time, take that as a plus. But if he demands that you spend every available second with him, take that to mean he’s less interested in keeping you happy than keeping himself happy.Remember: this works both ways.

A big indicator of attraction is how she responds to conversations. Is she looking away, making up reasons to leave, or sitting silently whenever you're not talking? If so, chances are good she is not interested in you. However, if you give a pause or lull in the conversation and after a second or two of silence and she reengages you by asking you a question such as “where are you from?” “How about you? Do you like xyz?”, that is a sign that she wants to keep the interaction going on between you two and see where the vibe is headed unwinds. This is an important precursor to her thinking you’re cute.  Body language is not the only way to see if someone thinks you're cute, but it is a great way to gauge how someone might feel about you. Good signs include:Touching you, especially on the arms or back.Smiling frequently at you.Making eye contact.Turning and facing you during conversations especially in group settings.Agreeing frequently, showing that she enjoys similar things.  Teasing is one of the best ways to subtly see where her heart is at. You never want to be mean, but making jokes, having small, competitive challenges in class, at recess, or at work, and slightly making fun of her for mistakes is classic flirting. If she engages back, teasing and joking with you, there is a good chance she thinks you're cute.Note, however, that some people are shy and don't show their affection this way. If she doesn't joke or tease back, but still smiles and seems interested, she might still think you're cute.  If you do this, observe whether the girl pays more attention to you or her friends. If it is friends, then you know she isn't crushing on you, but if she pays more attention to you, then you know that she is crushing on you. She may try to impress you, make lots of jokes, or spend most of her time talking to you.  Find a friend you both have in common and ask their opinion. Often another friend has the outside perspective needed figure out if their is mutual attraction. Know, however, that this can quickly turn into a rumor that leaves all of your friends asking ""do you have a crush on her?"" Only ask trusted friends their advice, and keep it to a minimum.  You can't control what she thinks about you, but you can control how you act around her. Be a gentleman by listening to her when she talks and offering to help her out when possible. She may not think you're cute now, but with simple, easy gestures like holding the door open or asking how she is doing each morning you can give her a great impression to remember you by.  This may be the most terrifying-seeming action in the world, but that doesn't make it any less important. The only way to really know if she thinks you're cute is to let her know you find her cute. This doesn't have to be a grand, enormous profession of love. In fact, it shouldn't be -- it should be casual and lighthearted. Let her know ""I think you're cute,"" give a light smile, and move on if she rejects you.

Avoid tired old lines. Try not to encourage them. Don't disconnect. Be ready for questions. Don't get angry. Try to forget. Let things go back to normal.,How to Tell a Friend With a Crush on You That You Just Want to Stay Friends,"The same old ""I don't want to wreck our friendship"" or ""Sorry, but I just don't like you that way"" will come out sounding cold and heartless. Instead of just telling your friend that you don't want a relationship, list specific reasons why you think dating would be a bad idea. ""I really appreciate that, but I just think we should stick to being friends. I mean, I tell you everything about me! That would be a little awkward for me if we were dating."" And hey, if you don't feel the love for your friend at the time, but could see something blossoming in the future, don't be afraid to tell them that, too!;, Take a bit of time to reflect on your actions toward your friend lately. Have you said or done anything that they may take to be an advance? Or maybe you're just a particularly flirty person. Make sure you turn off the charm around your friend, at least until things cool down a bit.  It can be tempting to give your friend a little ""space"" to help them get over you. This isn't wise, simply because your friend is likely to take this as a clue to back off for good. It may also leave your friend feeling guilty about or ashamed of confessing their feelings to you. Let them know that things are okay between you two, and try your best to text, talk on the phone, and hang out just as much as you did before your friend asked you out. And if you're the one being cut off? Take this as a silent memo that your friend needs a little time to sort things out. Try to make contact after a week or two, and if there isn't any response, take this as a cue to put your friendship on hiatus.  ""Why can't we date?"" ""Is it because I'm not as attractive as you?"" ""Are you embarrassed by me?"" ""Is there someone else?"" These are all questions you should be prepared for in the event that a friend should ask you out. Take time and give the best answers you possibly can in a calm, gentle way. Make sure your friend knows that it's okay to be curious about what's going on in your head, but it's not okay to constantly badger you with annoying questions and pleadings. If the whys and what ifs haven't ceased after a week, give your friend a stern reminder that you just aren't interested and you don't owe him/her any other answers.  Sure, there are a million annoying things about the situation: the immediate awkwardness, the constant questions, and the broken-hearted look in your friend's eyes, just to name a few. It's important, though, that you don't get angry. If you lash out at your friend, they may think they are seeing a dark side of you that hasn't come out before. They may also feel like they somehow inconvenienced you by having a crush on you. When you feel like screaming at this friend to forget it, remember that all you're going to do is make them feel cruddy, which isn't what you want.  Naturally, the only thing on your mind is going to be what they're thinking about when you're together. Try to push this out of your mind though. Focus on what you liked about your friend before they liked you. Maybe it was their sense of humor or indispensable advice. Whatever it may be, keep that on your mind the first few times you hang out after you're asked out. Remember that your friend is the same person they were before they liked you.  Play things right, and slowly but surely, your friendship will go from being awkward to being the gemstone it once was.","['The same old ""I don\'t want to wreck our friendship"" or ""Sorry, but I just don\'t like you that way"" will come out sounding cold and heartless.', ""Instead of just telling your friend that you don't want a relationship, list specific reasons why you think dating would be a bad idea."", '""I really appreciate that, but I just think we should stick to being friends.', 'I mean, I tell you everything about me!', 'That would be a little awkward for me if we were dating.""', ""And hey, if you don't feel the love for your friend at the time, but could see something blossoming in the future, don't be afraid to tell them that, too!;, Take a bit of time to reflect on your actions toward your friend lately."", 'Have you said or done anything that they may take to be an advance?', ""Or maybe you're just a particularly flirty person."", 'Make sure you turn off the charm around your friend, at least until things cool down a bit.', 'It can be tempting to give your friend a little ""space"" to help them get over you.', ""This isn't wise, simply because your friend is likely to take this as a clue to back off for good."", 'It may also leave your friend feeling guilty about or ashamed of confessing their feelings to you.', 'Let them know that things are okay between you two, and try your best to text, talk on the phone, and hang out just as much as you did before your friend asked you out.', ""And if you're the one being cut off?"", 'Take this as a silent memo that your friend needs a little time to sort things out.', ""Try to make contact after a week or two, and if there isn't any response, take this as a cue to put your friendship on hiatus."", '""Why can\'t we date?""', '""Is it because I\'m not as attractive as you?""', '""Are you embarrassed by me?""', '""Is there someone else?""', 'These are all questions you should be prepared for in the event that a friend should ask you out.', 'Take time and give the best answers you possibly can in a calm, gentle way.', ""Make sure your friend knows that it's okay to be curious about what's going on in your head, but it's not okay to constantly badger you with annoying questions and pleadings."", ""If the whys and what ifs haven't ceased after a week, give your friend a stern reminder that you just aren't interested and you don't owe him/her any other answers."", ""Sure, there are a million annoying things about the situation: the immediate awkwardness, the constant questions, and the broken-hearted look in your friend's eyes, just to name a few."", ""It's important, though, that you don't get angry."", ""If you lash out at your friend, they may think they are seeing a dark side of you that hasn't come out before."", 'They may also feel like they somehow inconvenienced you by having a crush on you.', ""When you feel like screaming at this friend to forget it, remember that all you're going to do is make them feel cruddy, which isn't what you want."", ""Naturally, the only thing on your mind is going to be what they're thinking about when you're together."", 'Try to push this out of your mind though.', 'Focus on what you liked about your friend before they liked you.', 'Maybe it was their sense of humor or indispensable advice.', ""Whatever it may be, keep that on your mind the first few times you hang out after you're asked out."", 'Remember that your friend is the same person they were before they liked you.', 'Play things right, and slowly but surely, your friendship will go from being awkward to being the gemstone it once was.']"
"A week before the prom/dance, purchase a tuxedo that fits you.

Note where he places himself. Suggest activities you know he’s not into. Ask to join him in his favorite things. Keep track of his promises. Ask him for favors. Test his memory. Talk about the future.,How to Tell If a Guy Cares2,"When you’re together, pay attention to where he orients himself in relation to you–especially when you’re out with other people. Think of the physical distance between the two of you as the emotional distance that he wants to maintain. The farther he keeps his body away when you’re sitting or standing together, the less he wants others to think of you two as being together.Take this less to heart if you know he tends to be shy or reserved. If that's your guy, he could be nervous around you because he cares about you, or he may want to avoid coming across as someone who's going to smother you.  If he hates romantic comedies, ask him to go see one with you. If he doesn’t particularly like one or more of your friends, ask him to come along when you go out to see them. Test how willing he is to keep you happy. If he’s happy to do things that he’d rather not do just to keep you happy, be assured that this means he cares about you.Be careful not to overdo it. If all you ever do is drag him to places that you know he doesn't like, he may start to resent it after a while.  If he goes surfing every weekend, say you want to come along to the beach even if you don’t know how to surf. If he has a regular hang-out that he goes to, like an arcade or coffee shop, suggest going together. See how willing he is to include you in all aspects of his life.Respect the fact that everyone needs to do their own thing if he doesn’t want to make a habit out of bringing you along every single time. But at the very least he should be willing to include you every once and a while just so you can see what matters so much to him.  When he says he’s going to do something, note whether he actually does it. Pay attention to how punctual he is when you’re supposed to meet or call each other. If he fails to show up on time, ask for the reason why and see if it’s a valid excuse.Everyone runs late or forgets to do stuff every now and then. But if he consistently fails to follow through on his word, consider that a sign that he doesn’t think of you as someone worth proving himself to.  Whether it’s big or small, see how quickly he offers to do it. If he fetches you another soda from the fridge just so you don’t have to get up, or gives you his jacket because you feel a chill, then he cares about you. If he does it without thinking twice about it or expecting a reward, he cares even more.Obviously, if it’s a really big favor, like “fix my car,” he’ll probably have to think things over at first, if only to figure out if and when he could possibly do such a time-consuming project.  In passing, refer back to a previous conversation you’ve had with him. If you told him a story about school or work last week, tell him how things turned out since then. See how much he remembers from the first story.Of course, he may not have the same job as you or attend the same class, so he may not have had a strong grasp on all the details in the first place. But expect him to at least remember the point of the story.  Mention your own hopes and plans. Ask him where he sees himself a year from now, in five years, in ten. Pay close attention to how he answers. See how much your two visions conflict with each other, and if they do, how much effort he makes into combining the two into one shared vision. The more he talks about “we” and the less he uses “I,” the more likely he thinks of you as someone to plan his own future around.","['When you’re together, pay attention to where he orients himself in relation to you–especially when you’re out with other people.', 'Think of the physical distance between the two of you as the emotional distance that he wants to maintain.', 'The farther he keeps his body away when you’re sitting or standing together, the less he wants others to think of you two as being together.', 'Take this less to heart if you know he tends to be shy or reserved.', ""If that's your guy, he could be nervous around you because he cares about you, or he may want to avoid coming across as someone who's going to smother you."", 'If he hates romantic comedies, ask him to go see one with you.', 'If he doesn’t particularly like one or more of your friends, ask him to come along when you go out to see them.', 'Test how willing he is to keep you happy.', 'If he’s happy to do things that he’d rather not do just to keep you happy, be assured that this means he cares about you.', 'Be careful not to overdo it.', ""If all you ever do is drag him to places that you know he doesn't like, he may start to resent it after a while."", 'If he goes surfing every weekend, say you want to come along to the beach even if you don’t know how to surf.', 'If he has a regular hang-out that he goes to, like an arcade or coffee shop, suggest going together.', 'See how willing he is to include you in all aspects of his life.', 'Respect the fact that everyone needs to do their own thing if he doesn’t want to make a habit out of bringing you along every single time.', 'But at the very least he should be willing to include you every once and a while just so you can see what matters so much to him.', 'When he says he’s going to do something, note whether he actually does it.', 'Pay attention to how punctual he is when you’re supposed to meet or call each other.', 'If he fails to show up on time, ask for the reason why and see if it’s a valid excuse.', 'Everyone runs late or forgets to do stuff every now and then.', 'But if he consistently fails to follow through on his word, consider that a sign that he doesn’t think of you as someone worth proving himself to.', 'Whether it’s big or small, see how quickly he offers to do it.', 'If he fetches you another soda from the fridge just so you don’t have to get up, or gives you his jacket because you feel a chill, then he cares about you.', 'If he does it without thinking twice about it or expecting a reward, he cares even more.', 'Obviously, if it’s a really big favor, like “fix my car,” he’ll probably have to think things over at first, if only to figure out if and when he could possibly do such a time-consuming project.', 'In passing, refer back to a previous conversation you’ve had with him.', 'If you told him a story about school or work last week, tell him how things turned out since then.', 'See how much he remembers from the first story.', 'Of course, he may not have the same job as you or attend the same class, so he may not have had a strong grasp on all the details in the first place.', 'But expect him to at least remember the point of the story.', 'Mention your own hopes and plans.', 'Ask him where he sees himself a year from now, in five years, in ten.', 'Pay close attention to how he answers.', 'See how much your two visions conflict with each other, and if they do, how much effort he makes into combining the two into one shared vision.', 'The more he talks about “we” and the less he uses “I,” the more likely he thinks of you as someone to plan his own future around.']"
Note how much he includes you. Talk about meeting his family and/or friends. Watch him with your pet.,How to Tell If a Guy Cares3,"When you’re out with other people, pay attention to where he focuses his own attention. Stay quiet for a while and see how long it takes him to draw you back into the conversation, or if he forgets about you entirely. If you’re at a large party and separate to talk to different people, check how frequently he comes back to touch base with you, if only for a moment.Be sure to do this on a case-by-case basis. The situation will probably be at least a little bit different each time. If he hasn't seen a certain friend in a very long time, for instance, he may understandably focus more on them. Look for consistent behavior over time instead of singling out just one occasion.  Watch his reaction to the idea. If he seems reluctant to introduce you, ask him why. If he can’t give you a good reason, or if he says ""sure"" all the time but keeps putting it off, question why a guy who supposedly cares about you wouldn’t want other people in his life to meet you.Remember: he may have a valid reason for being reluctant. He may be more worried about what you think of his friends than the other way around. Or his family life may not be the best situation. Encourage him to talk freely about his concerns. The more he confides, the more he cares.  Observe how he behaves with your favorite animal in the whole world. See if they get along right off the bat, and if not, what sort of effort he makes to befriend it.

If you send too much attention to her all at once, it may come off like you are trying too hard.Do not like only the cute pictures of her. You can like one photo where you feel like she looks particularly good, but if you like too many pictures of her looking pretty, you may come off creepy. Consider liking a variety of things that she posts rather than just her pictures. , If you have been liking or commenting on her posts, provide her with material to comment back on. Post clever or interesting thoughts you have about the world and people, share beautiful or interesting pictures that you have taken, or find funny gifs, pictures or quotes from the internet that you can post along with a comment about why you like it.Consider what she would find funny or interesting. You don’t want to post things for her; however, you want to take into consideration that her internet style might be different from yours.Take a look at her posts and the things she likes to get an idea of her online interests and style. For example, if she writes a lot of posts about bands she likes and you share a band you like in common, you can post one of their music videos or the lyrics from one of their songs with a comment about why you like it.Stay true to yourself. Only post things that you genuinely like and are a part of who you are. It can come off fake if you are posting about things you haven’t shown an interest in before.  You should make a comment on a post that she writes early after it has been posted. If you write the comment early, she will be more likely to respond. Look for things that she is into that is a common interest you share, like your music taste, love of food, love of movies, etc.. Consider praising the post, asking a question about it, or commenting about something you find interesting about it.For example, if she writes a post about going to a show, you can respond “I am so jealous you got to see them! Did you think they were good live?”Hopefully your comments will spark a chain of comments back and forth. If this happens, you should send her a message asking her how she is doing or extending the conversation. Say “Hey, I am enjoying our conversation. How have you been? Are there any other bands you have been listening to lately that I should check out?”, Follow the inline citations to learn how to create an event on either platform. You can either create an event, or you can invite her to an event you are attending. For example, if you are going to a music festival that you think she would like, invite her to the event. There are several events that are open invite. You can send her an invitation by going to the page of the event and sending the invite from that page. Or if you and your friends are throwing a Halloween party, for example, make an event for it and invite her.After you invite her, you should send her a follow up message saying hello and telling her about the event. Say something like, “Hey, my friends and I are having a Halloween party and I was thinking it would be great to see you again. Are you free for Halloween?”If she cannot come to the event, use the event as an opportunity to continue messaging her. Ask her about how things have been going, and start a conversation with her.  Whichever way that you decide to reach out to her, you can follow the same tactic as writing a comment. Send her a message with a praise, talk about some common ground that you have, or ask her a question. Send a message that praises her for something she has recently done or accomplished. For example, if she recently finished a program or got a new pet, for example, send her a message saying congratulations, and then ask her how she has been lately.Talk about something that you share in common. For example, if she did a hike recently and you also like to go hiking, send her a message that say something like “I saw that you went on a hike to Palm Canyon. I was just there a couple of months ago and really enjoyed the waterfalls- did you like the trail?”.Ask her a question about something she has posted. Say something like “I saw the pictures you posted of you surfing- what kind of board do you have? I love surfing and go every chance I get.”","['This is an indirect but potentially effective way to get back in touch.', 'This is something that you can do to build up your courage to talk to her, or this can be a primer for starting a conversation.', 'Liking her posts or retweeting her tweets will remind her of you, and let her know that you are following her posts.', 'Do not like everything she posts.', 'Choose one or two things that you genuinely like and space out the time between your likes to every few days.', 'If you send too much attention to her all at once, it may come off like you are trying too hard.', 'Do not like only the cute pictures of her.', 'You can like one photo where you feel like she looks particularly good, but if you like too many pictures of her looking pretty, you may come off creepy.', 'Consider liking a variety of things that she posts rather than just her pictures.', ', If you have been liking or commenting on her posts, provide her with material to comment back on.', 'Post clever or interesting thoughts you have about the world and people, share beautiful or interesting pictures that you have taken, or find funny gifs, pictures or quotes from the internet that you can post along with a comment about why you like it.', 'Consider what she would find funny or interesting.', 'You don’t want to post things for her; however, you want to take into consideration that her internet style might be different from yours.', 'Take a look at her posts and the things she likes to get an idea of her online interests and style.', 'For example, if she writes a lot of posts about bands she likes and you share a band you like in common, you can post one of their music videos or the lyrics from one of their songs with a comment about why you like it.', 'Stay true to yourself.', 'Only post things that you genuinely like and are a part of who you are.', 'It can come off fake if you are posting about things you haven’t shown an interest in before.', 'You should make a comment on a post that she writes early after it has been posted.', 'If you write the comment early, she will be more likely to respond.', 'Look for things that she is into that is a common interest you share, like your music taste, love of food, love of movies, etc..

Talk to her about her boyfriend. See if she's happy in her current relationship. See if she's even interested in you. Don't get stuck in the Friend Zone. Know which girls are just not worth talking to. Treat her with respect. Let her make the calls. Find a way to hang out. Make her feel special. Let her see that you're interested. Show her how awesome you are. Be refreshing. Be persistent (without being annoying). Get together with her. Take it slow. Avoid talking about her ex-boyfriend. Don't get paranoid. Get a fresh start.,How to Talk to a Girl That You Like if She Has a Boyfriend,"If the boyfriend is one of your close friends, then yeah, it's a very good idea to back off unless you want to ruin your friendship. But if you don't know who the boyfriend is and want to get a sense of her relationship with him, then you can try to slyly get a sense of her relationship and how serious it is without prying too much. Here's what you can say:""What are you up to this weekend?""""How long have you been with your boyfriend?""""I had a girlfriend, but we broke up a few months ago. It was hard, but I feel much better about it now."";, Though you can't just come out and ask her if she's happy, you can get a sense about it just by talking. Basically, if she complains to you about her boyfriend all the time then that is a strong sign that her relationship is not looking so good. See if you can get an idea of how she's feeling just by making casual comments and seeing if she responds in the negative or affirmative. Basically, you don't want to try to get with a girl who is in a great, or a particularly long, relationship; you don't want to deal with the emotional baggage even if she does decide to end things.Say, ""It must be nice to live with your partner. What's that like?""Or say, ""You've been together for two years? That's a pretty long time…"", Before you step further, see if the girl even cares about you in a romantic way. Read the signs. Does she go out of her way to talk to you? Does she light up when you walk into the room? Does she make excuses to always be at your side? Does she even flirt a little bit? If so, then yeah, there's a good chance that she may have a crush on you. Here are some other ways you can see if this is the case:Talk about other girls in front of her. Without being too obvious about it, see if she gets jealous.Give her a compliment or two. See if she gives one back later.  If you want to get with the girl, then you can't turn into her best friend, the guy she can come to with all of her problems. Though talking to her about her boyfriend and relationship in the beginning can be a good way to get a sense of what's really going on, the last thing you want to do is to be the guy who she comes to with a carton of Cherry Garcia at midnight so she can cry about her communication issues with her boyfriend. You want to be seen as another romantic prospect, plain and simple, not as her new BFF.Though you do want to be seen as a romantic prospect, that does not mean you want her to see you as a sharper, snazzier, version of her current boyfriend. She should see you as someone completely new, refreshing, and exciting, not as another guy she can take to the movies and hold hands with.If she starts complaining to you about her boyfriend issues, say, ""Hey, you can save that stuff for your best friend. I just really don't want to go there, okay?"", If you want to talk to a girl you like who has a boyfriend in the hopes of breaking up her relationship and having it lead to something more, then you should make sure you're talking to a girl who is worth it, a girl who is really interested in you and not just with flirting with you and then coming home to her boyfriend. Here are some girls to avoid:The girl who lets you take her out to dinner and the movies only to go home to her boyfriend. Don't take her out like you're her boyfriend unless you actually are her boyfriend. She may just be using you for free food and drinks.The girl who flirts with you for months but doesn't let it go anywhere. Don't be with the perpetual flirt, who just likes to get attention from guys and nothing more.The girl with the crazy boyfriend. You do not want to get mixed up in that.The girl who is just looking for a guy-pal. (See above about avoiding the Friend Zone at all costs).The girl who is just using you to make her boyfriend jealous. Stay as far away as possible.  If you want the girl to like you, then you have to be respectful of her, and of the fact that she has a boyfriend. Don't make jokes about the boyfriend, be sleazy, always try to put your arm around her, or say demeaning things about the boyfriend or her relationship. If you really want her to like you, then you have to treat her like a lady. You can compliment her but don't make it look like you are perfectly OK hitting on a girl who has a boyfriend; let her start to see that there's something special about you.Even if she is entertaining the idea of being with you, nothing will put it out of her mind faster than if you blatantly try to hook up with her.  Get her to the point where she really likes you and wants to spend more time together. Mention a movie you want to see and see if she asks to come along. Tell her about a party you're throwing and see if she'd like to be there. The ball should be in her court so she can make these decisions on her own and not feel like you're putting too much pressure on her. Play a little bit hard to get; you have a lot going on and plenty of girls who want you, and if she's interested, she should get in line.Letting her realize how awesome you are just by being your charming self is better than degrading yourself by begging her to hang out with you when you know she is taken.  Whether you're studying together, going to the same party, or just randomly ending up at a cafe after class, make sure you spend some time with her. Don't just flirt over text or send her Facebook messages if you actually want to get somewhere. If you think it would be too weird to hang out alone, hang out with her in a group setting first. But try to get her alone when you can, so she can start thinking about you in a romantic way, and really noticing the fact that you two have a lot of chemistry.  Let her see that you see something unique in her, and that you're not just trying to get together with her because you think she's hot. Compliment her hair, an aspect of her personality, or her ability to work so hard in school. You shouldn't hit on her, touch her, or be too obvious about it, but you should let her know that you really see something in her. If she has a feeling that you really have a sense of the amazing person she is, then she will start to see that you may be the right guy for her.Show her that you really care about what she thinks. Ask her what she thinks about your new shoes, your chemistry teacher, or a new band you like. Let her see that you really value her thoughts.  You don't need to spell it out for her, but you should let her see that you view her as more than a friend. You can do this through compliments, suggestions that you really care about her, or just by making eye contact and standing close to her when you talk. Here are some things you can say:""I think your new haircut really makes your eyes stand out. It looked great before, but it's even prettier now.""""You're one of the only girls I've met who loves sports and who is really fun to talk to about almost anything. That's so cool.""""I really feel like I can talk to you about anything."", You shouldn't have to fake it to impress the girl and make her see that you're a guy worth knowing. Stay modest while letting her see that you have potential, that you're smart, cool, talented, and interesting and someone who would be perfect for her. Just be your best self without feeling like you're being dishonest.Open up to her about the things that matter to you. Just make sure that she's also opening up.After you tell her something that might be a bit private, you can say, ""I haven't talked to anyone about that in a long time. It's just so easy to talk to you, for some reason."", Remember what we said about how the last thing she wants is another guy who is exactly like her boyfriend? Well, it's absolutely true. Be spontaneous. Be fun. Don't call or text her every five minutes just to ""check in"". Come up with something completely random and fun that you can do together. Give her an original compliment or a funny little gift. Ask her to dance in the middle of the street. Just do whatever a normal, boring old boyfriend wouldn't do. Make her feel alive every time the two of you are together.Don't be afraid to talk to her about something that you think may be a little random if it's funny or interesting. You don't have to fit any kind of mold.  This is a delicate balance to find. You want her to know that you want her without coming on too strong or always being up in her grill. Talk to her at parties, walk alongside her after class, but do not become the guy that she can flirt and have some fun with before she comes home to her boyfriend. Be around, let her know you're interested, but also let her see that you won't wait around forever for her to make the call.  If you just flirt around with her for months, she'll think it's perfectly okay for her to have a guy to flirt with and a guy she is dating. Well, that's not cool, and the longer you go for this, the more she'll see that she can string you along without ever making a move. So, it's time to make a move, have her respond, or get her to make a move already, whether it means kissing you and getting with her boyfriend. Ideally, of course, she'll break up with her boyfriend and then get with you.Seriously, the sooner this can happen, the better. If you've been flirting around for over a month, chances are, she'll never make the break.  So, you've snagged the girl, she's dumped her loser boyfriend, and now you've finally gotten what you want. Does this mean you should go shopping for engagement rings or take a weekend trip to the Bahamas? Absolutely not. Even if the girl got out of a bad relationship, it's likely that she's still reeling, so give her some time and space. If you try to hang out with her every second of every day, she's likely to feel overwhelmed and to back away. Instead, give her space and hang out with her once or twice a week, or however many times she's ready for.This is something people don't get: break-ups are always painful, even if you're the person who did the breaking up. You may think that she feels totally free and happy because she got rid of the dead weight in her life, but she'll still be dealing with pain, and the inevitable grief that comes from saying goodbye to something, even if it wasn't all that great, and you have to be understanding of that.Though she shouldn't be the one to call or text you every time, make sure to give her some of the power. If you're the one who initiates contact every time, she may think that she's not ready for another boyfriend or for anything serious.  Whether she got out of a three month relationship with a real jerk or a five-year relationship with a nice but boring guy, you should never bring up the guy, especially if you want to make fun of him, call him a loser, remind her that he wasn't good enough for her, etc. Though your intentions may be pure and you may just want to make her feel better about ending something that wasn't working, she may take this as an assault on her former relationship, and may be offended, because it's likely that she still has tender feelings for her ex.Give it time. If she was in a five year relationship, then yeah, she may not be ready to talk about that part of her life for a long time. Maybe even a year will pass before she brings up her ex at all, because it will hurt too much to do it before hand. Be patient. If you keep asking questions about her ex, you'll come off as jealous and she'll get annoyed.Yeah, there may be this whole part of her life that you don't have access to for a while because it has to do with her ex. Nobody said snagging a girl with a boyfriend was easy, or that it didn't have consequences. But if you wait out this painful period, it'll be worth it.  Okay, so you grabbed a girl with a boyfriend, and only now does it dawn on you -- if she was able to cheat (or just emotionally cheat) on her boyfriend with another guy, then what will keep her from being unfaithful to you with the next guy who comes along? Well, hopefully she got out of her last relationship because it was truly bad and because she saw something special in you, not because she was generally restless. If she has a pattern of this behavior, then that is something to worry about, but if not, unfortunately, the heart does wander sometimes if it's worth it.Your job is to focus on your new relationship instead of worrying that she's seeing someone on the side; if you're constantly jealous and paranoid because of the way that you met, then your newfound love will never wok.If she just got out of something serious, the last thing she may want is to feel like she's smothered all over again and can't go more than ten minutes without checking in with you.  So, the two of you are together, maybe even officially dating. Sure, you might have met in a somewhat sketchy way, but that doesn't mean you have to bring it up all the time. Focus on what's ahead of you instead of looking behind, and work on building a solid foundation for your love, not one that's based on lies, deceit, and uncertainty. Even if you had a rocky beginning, you may be able to form a strong bond, though yeah, it'll be tougher than if you were just two single people who met at bar. If you do want it to work, focus on the things you will do together, instead of any of the pain that is behind you.This doesn't mean you can never talk about the period when you were getting together on the d/l. But it does mean that you should focus on all of the great things ahead of you, not on the pain that you might have felt in the beginning.Find new things that neither of you have done that you have always wanted to try, whether it's making your own sushi or going on a long hike. Find things you can claim as yours and that you can use to build a solid foundation for your love. Then just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!","['If the boyfriend is one of your close friends, then yeah,', ""it's a very good idea to back off unless you want to ruin your friendship."", ""But if

"Wait for the right time and place to start a conversation. Talk to your crush like you already know him or her. Think about what he or she might be interested in talking about. Freshen your breath before you talk. Make a funny or playful comment about the place you are at or thing you are doing. Get the update on something he or she has been doing, especially if you share something in common. Ask for his or her opinion on something easy to talk about. Ask him or her something unexpected but easy to answer. Go with an opening line that pops in your head. Ask questions about his or her interests, hobbies, or work. Be an active listener in your conversation. Show him or her that you are enjoying yourself in conversation. Make a plan to hang out again, and/or get his or her number.If things seem to be going well, ask your crush if he or she wants to hang out again or ask for his or her number. Bring the conversation back to something you already talked about. End the conversation on a good note.",How to Start a Conversation with Your Crush Without It Being Awkward,"A lot of awkwardness can be avoided if you can find a good time to talk to your crush. A good time to start a conversation could be before school, during lunch or a break, or after school or after an event is over. Use down time as an opportunity to start a conversation. A good place to talk could be at a bus stop, in a bus or on public transit, in a lunchroom, at a dance, or at a get together.Make sure you have enough time for at least a few minutes of conversation. There are some down time periods that are too short for a conversation. An example of a bad time to talk to someone would be if class is about to start. This is probably not a great time to try to have a conversation because you will be interrupted and will feel silly that you tried to start a conversation at that time.Avoid trying to start a conversation in a line or during a passing period.Think about the way your schedule and your crushes’ schedule overlaps. Plan on starting a conversation when both of you are free.Are there any events that are coming up? Think about if there are any dances, parties, or school events that are coming up that you can start a conversation with him or her at.  One way that conversations can become awkward is when one person is extra stiff with the other person; treating him or her like a stranger. Instead, treat your crush as though you are already friendly with him or her. Even though it may be true that you do not know your crush well, you should still talk to him or her with warmth and a friendly tone. You can even start a conversation with an introduction while using a tone of familiarity and warmth by saying something like, “Hi, I don’t know if we have actually met. I’m Tim, how’s it going?”When you are talking to your friends, try to notice your tone of voice, the hand gestures you use, and the kind of expressions you use. When you are talking with your crush, try to be the same kind of natural and relaxed while you talk.Don’t be overly familiar with him or her as though you have a history you do not have. For example, you wouldn’t say “Hey dude. How’s it?”.  If you are familiar with your crushes interests, life, friends, likes, dislikes, etc.  use that knowledge to your advantage. You don’t have to focus on those things in particular when you talk, but you can talk about things related to his or her interests. For example, if you know that he or she loves the beach, you can talk about the surfing you have done recently. And you don’t have to mention that you know that the person likes the beach. Just talk about it like you would talk to a friend who loves the beach.Awkward conversation can happen when you pretend like you know more about the person than you do in the same way that it can become awkward when you act like you don’t know anything about him/her at all when that is not true.  This is an easy way to feel confident in yourself and avoid awkwardness. Buy a pack of sugarless gum with xylitol to take with you to school or wherever you meet your crush. Sugarless gum will cause your mouth to make saliva which will in turn make your breath better and make it easier for you to talk. Pop a piece in your mouth 5 minutes after a meal and a few minutes before you talk with your crush. If you are going to a dance or somewhere you might be up close and personal with him or her, you can gargle with a mouth wash after you brush your teeth to freshen your breath.Avoid eating food that will make your breath smell like onions and garlic.Drink a glass of water, this will flush out any of the food and bacteria that make for bad breath.  Use your comment as an icebreaker to start the conversation. Look around and observe what is going on around you. Is there anything funny or interesting that you notice? For example, if it is lunch and the food truck hasn’t arrived yet, you can say “Are they going to get us water for this wait, or do they want us to die?” If you are going to remark on something simple, try to make it playful. Even if you don’t think of yourself as a funny person, you can still be playful. And playfulness is found to be very attractive to both guys and girls. This playfulness will make the conversation fun and will help keep the mood light.Don’t worry, the first few comments you make to your crush are not going to make or break the conversation. Getting the conversation started is more important. So don’t worry too much about being smooth, and focus instead on continuing conversation.  Once you have broken in with an opening line, move on into something you can talk about more. Asking for an update is a good question to ask if you do already know the person a little bit or you are taking a class together, for example. It is good idea to acknowledge your familiarity with one another by talking about the thing you have in common. This will make the conversation less awkward, and you will also get a better understanding of what is going on with the other person in your shared thing. For example, if you are taking a class together you can say, “So how is your midterm paper coming together?”You don’t have to mention the fact that you are in a class together unless you aren’t sure that he or she knows. If you want to remind him or her, do it without making a big deal out of it. Say “So in English class, how is your midterm paper coming together?” It is not weird that you know that you share a class. If he or she doesn’t know, you mentioning the class first will tip him or her off and he or she will probably apologize for not recognizing you.  Topics of conversation can go by pretty quickly, and so it can be good to have a couple of open ended and easy to answer questions lined up to ask your crush. You can start by telling him or her something that you do or know and then ask his or her opinion on it. This question can also be related to the context of where you are or what you are doing. For example, if you are eating an apple at lunch you could say “I personally know that Granny Smith apples are the best apples in the world, but out of curiosity, what kind of apple is your favorite?” Once again, being playful is a good way to make your conversation less awkward and more fun, especially when you are talking about simple topics and just getting your conversation going.You don’t want to ask him or her something too controversial. Stay away from any hot button topics like politics or religion. , You should try to make a unique connection based on your conversation and the particular person you are talking to. You can ask your crush something unusual but fun. For example, you could ask him or her something like “Is there a celebrity that people say, or you think, that you look like?”. This kind of question could make him or her laugh. Once he or she tells you his or her celebrity look alike, you can say whether you agree or disagree, and you can tell him or her who your celebrity look alike is (and you can lie as a joke).Avoid small talk or getting to know you questions. You don’t want to ask questions like “So where are you from?” because you will get an answer he or she has already used many times before.This kind of playful conversation helps you get more comfortable with one another.  If you don’t have many opportunities to talk to your crush and you see a good one, even if you don’t have everything mapped out, you may want to seize the opportunity to talk to him or her by just going for it. Part of having a crush will always involve some amount of awkwardness and that can be part of the fun. So you don’t have to overthink it- go for it.Going for it is good because it will help you get over the barrier of initial contact. And remember, it isn’t very important how you start talking to him or her- the important part is continuing the conversation.Sometimes just going with your gut can bring out your most confident self.  Once you have established a good connection with your crush, you should start trying to get to know him or her better. Start with something that he or she has mentioned or that you have observed in your interactions. For example, “I see you have some books with you, what are you reading?” This is a low pressure question that lets your crush know you are interested in him or her. Then ask follow up questions.For example, if he or she is excited to talk about the books, ask more questions/make connections related to the books. For example, “That is cool that you are reading that book. My favorite book by that author is blank.”Or, if he or she doesn't seem too excited about his or her books, you can move onto something else more open ended. Say something like, “So what else are you up to this week?”.Avoid bring up topics of conversation that show that you already know about your crushes’ interests because that might make you feel awkward. For example, if you know he plays soccer, avoid bringing that up directly. Don’t say “So tell me about your soccer season.” Instead, let the conversation get there naturally.  Your crush will enjoy him/herself in a conversation with you much more if you are a good listener. Once you have started conversation, you should be face to face or in a listening position where you hear and see his or her face easily. Another key part of active listening is making consistent (but not constant) eye contact during your conversation.Avoid distractions. Don’t send a text or look at your phone while you talk. This will make it seem like you are disinterested and might keep you from really hearing what your crush is saying.Repeat the main idea of what your crush is saying. This will let him or her know that you are listening and will give him or her the chance to clarify anything. Repeat the most meaningful parts of what he or she is saying. For example, you can say “So are you saying that you are new to painting but it feels like you have been doing it forever?”. This will help him or her feel connected to you because you show that you understand important things about him or her.Avoid interrupting him or her in conversation. It is easy to get excited by what we want to say and interrupt during his or her turn in the conversation. But resist the temptation and wait until he or she has finished talking, and then show your enthusiasm for what he or she is saying.Be empathetic. If your crush talks about something hard that is going on with him or her, make sure you don’t skip over his or her feelings in the conversation. You could say in response to him or her talking about failing a test, something like, “I could understand why it would be really frustrating to have to retake that test.”, One way to keep a conversation friendly and natural is if you seem like you are having a good time talking with him or her. A few ways you can show this if you make eye contact, smile often, laugh, lean forward slightly when you are talking, and use open body language. Use any gestures when you talk that are natural for you, and keep your arms open and not crossed.Tilting your head to one side is another good way to show friendliness/playfulness when you are talking and flirting. , This is good to do around the three quarter point into your conversation. It is a good idea to suggest getting together or getting his or her number after you have made solid connections and before the conversation has become tired or worn out. Think about a couple of activities that would be right for you both before you have a conversation. Say something like, “You are really cool, would you want to hang out sometime?” Then suggest a couple of things you can do together and get his or her number.Or if you want to play it safer, you can simply ask “Hey, can I have your number? I have really enjoyed talking to you.”If you feel like the conversation was just okay, you can always wait for a couple more conversations through texting or in person before asking to him or her to hang out.  You might want to talk to your crush about something he or she talked about at the beginning of the conversation. For example, you can say, “So how much longer do you think you need to spend on your midterm paper?” And then spend the rest of the conversation finishing talking about the points of conversation you have already started.You can make inside jokes about what you talked about. For example, you can say “Well now that we have made it through this lunch period without water, I suppose we can get through anything together.”Making inside jokes can help you cement connections you have made, and it is a good way to make your connection last past the first conversation.  When you are feeling good and you have just finished laughing about something, you should politely end your conversation so that your crush is left with a good impression. Make sure to tell him or her that you enjoyed your conversation.You can keep the end of your conversation casual. You can say something like, “I should be getting home now, but I had a lot of fun talking to you.”If you are going to be seeing your crush in the future you should say something about seeing him or her again. Say, “I look forward to seeing you in class and hearing how your paper turned out.”Send a follow up text in the next couple of days saying hello and checking in with him or her about the things you talked about.","['A lot of awkwardness can be avoided if you can find a good time to talk to your crush.', 'A good time to start a conversation could be before school, during lunch or a break, or

"Send her a text bringing up a connection that you share. Be direct in your text, and tell her you have been thinking about her. Send her a text that is funny or silly. Keep your text conversation going. Suggest getting together to catch up more. Make new connections with her.",How to Talk to a Crush You Haven't Spoken to in a Long Time (for Guys)2,"Remind her of something that connected you in the past to test the waters. Be confident in your connection, and you can ask her a question related to your question as well.For example, you could say, “Hey, I saw the Lakers play yesterday, and I remember how you like them. How have you been? Did you see the game??”, You can still bring up a connection that you have without having to give a reason behind why you texted. However, don’t bring up anything heavy from the past to break the ice.Say something like, “Hey, I have been thinking about you lately and all of our fun conversations last summer. How have you been?”, Because studies show that girls like guys more if they find them funny, humor is always a smart way to go when you are talking with girls. You can reference an inside joke that you had or ask her a question as a joke.For example, say something silly like “How long has it been since we ate that giant tamale?”, After you have broke the ice, you can ask her questions about how she has been and respond with interest. Try to approximately match the length of texts that she sends you and wait time. For example, don’t text her back within a minute with three texts if she answered you with a line or two of text a couple of hours after you texted.Ask follow up questions like, “I didn’t know that you were working at a new restaurant. That’s cool! How do you like it?”, If she has been responding to your texts with friendly texts back, you should ask her if she wants to get together and catch up in person. If you ask her to get together, suggest an activity that you two could do together.  Instead of doing what you have done before, try doing new things and going to new places. If you usually get together and eat, for example, try going somewhere new. Go to a new neighborhood to eat, or make food at your house.","['Remind her of something that connected you in the past to test the waters.', 'Be confident in your connection, and you can ask her a question related to your question as well.', 'For example, you could say, “Hey, I saw the Lakers play yesterday, and I remember how you like them.', 'How have you been?', 'Did you see the game??”, You can still bring up a connection that you have without having to give a reason behind why you texted.', 'However, don’t bring up anything heavy from the past to break the ice.', 'Say something like, “Hey, I have been thinking about you lately and all of our fun conversations last summer.', 'How have you been?”, Because studies show that girls like guys more if they find them funny, humor is always a smart way to go when you are talking with girls.', 'You can reference an inside joke that you had or ask her a question as a joke.', 'For example, say something silly like “How long has it been since we ate that giant tamale?”, After you have broke the ice, you can ask her questions about how she has been and respond with interest.', 'Try to approximately match the length of texts that she sends you and wait time.', 'For example, don’t text her back within a minute with three texts if she answered you with a line or two of text a couple of hours after you texted.', 'Ask follow up questions like, “I didn’t know that you were working at a new restaurant.', 'That’s cool!', 'How do you like it?”', ', If she has been responding to your texts with friendly texts back, you should ask her if she wants to get together and catch up in person.', 'If you ask her to get together, suggest an activity that you two could do together.', 'Instead of doing what you have done before, try doing new things and going to new places.', 'If you usually get together and eat, for example, try going somewhere new.', 'Go to a new neighborhood to eat, or make food at your house.']"
"Think about where you will see her. Go up and say hi, and tell her you want to talk. Start a conversation with her. Tell her you are happy to see her. Ask her genuinely how she has been. Ask her follow up questions. Tell her interesting things that have been going on with you. Ask her if you can hang out again. Pay attention to her response. Follow up with a text or message.",How to Talk to a Crush You Haven't Spoken to in a Long Time (for Guys)3,"Maybe you are not trying to go out of your way to see your crush, but you share a friend group and want to be friendly and cool with her- you can use these steps to help create a good connection with her. Or if you want to get into contact with your old crush and you can’t or don’t want to contact her directly, hang out with the mutual friends you have, and go to events she will probably be at.You can call your friends and ask them about the events and parties that are coming up and then attend those events.Or if you know she goes to certain church activities, for example, you can start attending those activities again.Don’t use your friends to get to your crush. For example, when you hang out with your friends, be there to have a good time with them first, and consider seeing her second. That way if it doesn’t work out, you will still have a good time, and you won’t mistreat your friends.  When you first see each other, make sure you acknowledge her. If you see her across the room, give her a smile, and a friendly wave or greeting. If it doesn’t seem like a good time to talk, tell her “It is great to see you! I want to talk to you. Can you give me a minute?” You can finish doing what you are doing, and let her finish doing what she is doing, too.Giving yourself a minute will help you compose yourself and can add a good element of anticipation for your conversation.Think about an interesting topic of conversation or something that you can ask her about as an ice breaker before you walk up and talk to her. For example, you can make an observation about the party you are at by saying something like, “I like that they really made sure that all of our chip needs are met at this party.” Then gesture to a table covered in 10 different types of chips.  Once she is free to talk, start a conversation. If you are somewhere where it is difficult to talk, ask her, “Do you want to find a better place to talk?” Look for somewhere quiet and relaxed where you sit down and catch up uninterrupted.  If you two have any awkward history together, break through that barrier by expressing your positive feelings at seeing her again. Once you two are settled, show her that you are happy to see her again by smiling, making eye contact, and simply saying “I am happy to see you.” Being positive and direct will make you seem confident and can help overcome any weirdness either of you might feel at the start of the conversation.  Use your tone of voice and hand gestures to show her that you are interested in hearing about her. This will make you seem confident and happy to talk to her again. It can be a little less intimidating if you ask her how she is doing now because having to recount everything that has happened since the last time you saw each other might require a lot of explanation.Say something like, “I’d love to her how you are doing now.”Or you can start by saying what you remember of what she was doing last. For example, you can say “If I remember right, the last time we talked you were…”Avoid talking about anything awkward or difficult things from the past. If the conversation progresses that way naturally, you can talk about deeper topics, but at the beginning of the conversation you want to keep it light and positive.  When she tells you how her life has been, listen attentively by making eye contact, nodding along with what she says, restating her main ideas and asking her relevant questions. For example, if she says she has been having a hard week, ask her what has been going on that has made her week hard.  Think of positive, funny or lighter stories that will give her an idea of what you have been up to lately. Consider talking about topics that you know she is interested in.For example, if she loves marine biology, you can say “I went on a trip with my school recently to Catalina Island, and we had a blast snorkeling.”Mirror or match her energy level and body language in conversation. For example, if she is talking energetically and using lots of body language, use lots of body language in response and laugh often. Or if she seems a little more reserved, you can talk quieter and give her more physical distance. Don’t copy her gestures; however, do go for a similar level of energy.  After you feel like you have had a chance to catch up and made a good connection in your conversation, tell her you really liked talking and ask her about getting together again. After you have finished laughing about something, for example, you can say “I really liked talking with you again. We should get together again and continue catching up.”, If she seems interested in going out with you, make sure you have her correct contact information, and arrange to get together to do something in the near future. If she is ambiguous about whether she can hang out again, don’t push it. It is better to let her tell you when she is free. Sometimes people may be nervous in the moment and may come off uninterested, and at other times, they are sending you a message that they are not interested. Send her a follow up message or text to find out which is the case.For example, if she says something like “I don’t know, I’m going to be busy for a while.” You can say, “No problem, it was really good catching up with you. I’m glad we got the chance.”, If you got her information and you are going to get together soon, you should send a follow up text sometime in the next couple of days that says something like “It was really good catching up- I am excited to hang out again.” If she seemed like maybe she wanted to hang out again, then follow up with a simple message or text that says “It was really awesome catching up with you- let me know if you want to get together sometime.” This kind of text is low pressure while also getting across that you are interested in hanging out more.","['Maybe you are not trying to go out of your way to see your crush, but you share a friend group and want to be friendly and cool with her-', 'you can use these steps to help create a good connection with her.', 'Or if you want to get into contact with your old crush and you can’t or don’t want to contact her directly, hang out with the mutual friends you have, and go to events she will probably be at.', 'You can call your friends and ask them about the events and parties that are coming up and then attend those events.', 'Or if you know she goes to certain church activities, for example, you can start attending those activities again.', 'Don’t use your friends to get to your crush.', 'For example, when you hang out with your friends, be there to have a good time with them first, and consider seeing her second.', 'That way if it doesn’t work out, you will still have a good time, and you won’t mistreat your friends.', 'When you first see each other, make sure you acknowledge her.', 'If you see her across the room, give her a smile, and a friendly wave or greeting.', 'If it doesn’t seem like a good time to talk, tell her “It is great to see you!', 'I want to talk to you.', 'Can you give me a minute?”', 'You can finish doing what you are doing, and let her finish doing what she is doing, too.', 'Giving yourself a minute will help you compose yourself and can add a good element of anticipation for your conversation.', 'Think about an interesting topic of conversation or something that you can ask her about as an ice breaker before you walk up and talk to her.', 'For example, you can make an observation about the party you are at by saying something like, “I like that they really made sure that all of our chip needs are met at this party.”', 'Then gesture to a table covered in 10 different types of chips.', 'Once she is free to talk, start a conversation.', 'If you are somewhere where it is difficult to talk, ask her, “Do you want to find a better place to talk?”', 'Look for somewhere quiet and relaxed where you sit down and catch up uninterrupted.', 'If you two have any awkward history together, break through that barrier by expressing your positive feelings at seeing her again.', 'Once you two are settled, show her that you are happy to see her again by smiling, making eye contact, and simply saying “I am happy to see you.”', 'Being positive and direct will make you seem confident and can help overcome any weirdness either of you might feel at the start of the conversation.', 'Use your tone of voice and hand gestures to show her that you are interested in hearing about her.', 'This will make you seem confident and happy to talk to her again.', 'It can be a little less intimidating if you ask her how she is doing now because having to recount everything that has happened since the last time you saw each other might require a lot of explanation.', 'Say something like, “I’d love to her how you are doing now.', '”Or you can start by saying what you remember of what she was doing last.', 'For example, you can say “If I remember right, the last time we talked you were…”Avoid talking about anything awkward or difficult things from the past.', 'If the conversation progresses that way naturally, you can talk about deeper topics, but at the beginning of the conversation you want to keep it light and positive.', 'When she tells you how her life has been, listen attentively by making eye contact, nodding along with what she says, restating her main ideas and asking her relevant questions.', 'For example, if she says she has been having a hard week, ask her what has been going on that has made her week hard.', 'Think of positive, funny or lighter stories that will give her an idea of what you have been up to lately.', 'Consider talking about topics that you know she is interested in.', 'For example, if she loves marine biology, you can say “I went on a trip with my school recently to Catalina Island, and we had a blast snorkeling.', '”Mirror', 'or match her energy level and body language in conversation.', 'For example, if she is talking energetically and using lots of body language, use lots of body language in response and laugh often.', 'Or if she seems a little more reserved, you can talk quieter and give her more physical distance.', 'Don’t copy her gestures;

"Make eye contact. Pay attention to the rest of her face. Stare off to the side like you’re lost in thought. Find another place to rest your eyes. Get lost in conversation. Think of the consequences. If all else fails, pretend she’s your mother. Apologize if you're caught.",How to Stop Staring at a Girl's Boobs,"If you're talking to the girl, then you should stay focused on her face. If just looking into her eyes isn't enough for you, start to really study them. Note the color of her eyes, whether or not they are speckled, how they are shaped, what kind of eye makeup, if any, she is wearing, how long her lashes are, etc. Only do this if you don't think it's creeping her out, and if you're engaged in conversation.Even if you're focusing on her eyes, you should break eye contact from time to time so the girl doesn't feel creeped out or like you're paying too much attention to her face. , Pretend you have to give her description to a sketch artist and fixate on her facial features. Note the color of her eyebrows, the shape of her nose, the width of her cheekbones, whether or not she has freckles or moles, etc. If you’re an artist, try to memorize her face well enough to be able to sketch it later. Again, try not to stare. Keep your eye gaze natural and let it flit around the scenery around you two as well.This is best achieved by looking at her whole face at once and mentally noting her various features, not by eyeballing every area of her face individually. Be especially careful not to stare at her lips, as this can also be taken the wrong way.  If you don’t know her that well or feel like you’ve been staring too long, alternate between looking at her face and looking off to the side like you’re thinking or remembering something. (Looking up and to one side is especially effective, as it keeps your eyes from straying downwards.) Though this may feel weird to you at first, it’s very common for people to get lost in thought like this when they speak.  So making eye contact is great, but you can't do it 24/7 without freaking the girl out, so decide on a place where you will rest your eyes from time to time. It can be the clock above the girl's head, it can be your watch or the books you're holding, or it can be the door to the left of you. Whenever your eyes need to take a break, return them to that same location so they don't end up wandering over to an inappropriate area. One of the reasons that you may be looking at the girl's chest is because you feel the need to break eye contact and naturally rest your eyes on an appealing place.Sure, the girl may think it's a little strange that you're looking at the clock every minute, but that's better than staring at her chest, isn't it?, Talk to her about anything -- movies, school, events, or whatever interests you enough to distract you from her breasts. Practice the art of good conversation and attentive listening. If you're having a great conversation, then soon enough, you won't be thinking about her boobs. Think of ways to make her laugh, impress her, or to make her feel special, and soon enough, you'll be focusing on the right things.  If you do end up staring at the girl's boobs, she will definitely notice. She may call you out on it and embarrass you, or she may just feel bad and like you think of her as a sex object. Either way, looking at the girl's boobs won't make your relationship any better and can only lead to bad things. Here are some other consequences that may happen as a result of you staring at the girl's breasts:You may get an embarrassing erection from looking at her breasts for too long.You will likely lose any chance of asking her out or seducing her.She may tell other girls what happened and they won't want to hang out with you because they will think you're a pervert.  If nothing else is working for you, picture your mom’s face in place of hers. That should keep your eyeballs squared firmly above her shoulders. Though this may sounds a little bit gross, that's exactly the point -- do whatever you can to keep your eyes at eye level. Nobody said it was going to be fun. And hey, why not, you can also pretend she's your sister. Either way will keep you nice and respectful.  If the girl catches you staring at her chest and calls you out on it, then don't deny it, turn bright red, and call her a liar. Just fess up. Say, ""I'm so sorry, I know that was disrespectful."" Sure, that won't be pleasant for you, but it's better than looking like a wimp. Remember that seeing you looking at her chest probably wasn't all that pleasant for the girl, either.","[""If you're talking to the girl, then you should stay focused on her face."", ""If just looking into her eyes isn't enough for you, start to really study them."", 'Note the color of her eyes, whether or not they are speckled, how they are shaped, what kind of eye makeup, if any, she is wearing, how long her lashes are, etc.', ""Only do this if you don't think it's creeping her out, and if you're engaged in conversation."", ""Even if you're focusing on her eyes, you should break eye contact from time to time so the girl doesn't feel creeped out or like you're paying too much attention to her face."", ', Pretend you have to give her description to a sketch artist and fixate on her facial features.', 'Note the color of her eyebrows, the shape of her nose, the width of her cheekbones, whether or not she has freckles or moles, etc.', 'If you’re an artist, try to memorize her face well enough to be able to sketch it later.', 'Again, try not to stare.', 'Keep your eye gaze natural and let it flit around the scenery around you two as well.', 'This is best achieved by looking at her whole face at once and mentally noting her various features, not by eyeballing every area of her face individually.', 'Be especially careful not to stare at her lips, as this can also be taken the wrong way.', 'If you don’t know her that well or feel like you’ve been staring too long, alternate between looking at her face and looking off to the side like you’re thinking or remembering something.', '(Looking up and to one side is especially effective, as it keeps your eyes from straying downwards.)', 'Though this may feel weird to you at first, it’s very common for people to get lost in thought like this when they speak.', ""So making eye contact is great, but you can't do it 24/7 without freaking the girl out, so decide on a place where you will rest your eyes from time to time."", ""It can be the clock above the girl's head, it can be your watch or the books you're holding, or it can be the door to the left of you."", ""Whenever your eyes need to take a break, return them to that same location so they don't end up wandering over to an inappropriate area."", ""One of the reasons that you may be looking at the girl's chest is because you feel the need to break eye contact and naturally rest your eyes on an appealing place."", ""Sure, the girl may think it's a little strange that you're looking at the clock every minute, but that's better than staring at her chest, isn't it?,"", 'Talk to her about anything -- movies, school, events, or whatever interests you enough to distract you from her breasts.', 'Practice the art of good conversation and attentive listening.', ""If you're having a great conversation, then soon enough, you won't be thinking about her boobs."", ""Think of ways to make her laugh, impress her, or to make her feel special, and soon enough, you'll be focusing on the right things."", ""If you do end up staring at the girl's boobs, she will definitely notice."", 'She may call you out on it and embarrass you, or she may just feel bad and like you think of her as a sex object.', ""Either way, looking at the girl's boobs won't make your relationship any better and can only lead to bad things."", ""Here are some other consequences that may happen as a result of you staring at the girl's breasts:You may get an embarrassing erection from looking at her breasts for too long."", 'You will likely lose any chance of asking her out or seducing her.', ""She may tell other girls what happened and they won't want to hang out with you because they will think you're a pervert."", 'If nothing else is working for you, picture your mom’s face in place of hers.', 'That should keep your eyeballs squared firmly above her shoulders.', ""Though this may sounds a little bit gross, that's exactly the point -- do whatever you can to keep your eyes at eye level."", 'Nobody said it was going to be fun.', ""And hey, why not, you can also pretend she's your sister."", 'Either way will keep you nice and respectful.', ""If the girl catches you staring at her chest and calls you out on it, then don't deny it, turn bright red, and call her a liar."", 'Just fess up.', 'Say, ""I\'m so sorry, I know that was disrespectful.""', ""Sure, that won't be pleasant for you, but it's better than looking like a wimp."", ""Remember that seeing you looking at her chest probably wasn't all that pleasant for the girl, either.""]"
Pay attention to her tone of voice and body language. Do not assume too much. Think about whether she is already seeing someone. Think about whether she can date.,How to Respond to Your Crush Asking You if You Like Her1,"Consider why she is asking. If you have an idea about how she feels, it will help you have a more productive conversation with her. We communicate mainly through our tone of voice and body language, so try to understand what is going on using these signals.If she is raising her eyebrows, she might be uncomfortable. This might mean that she does not want you to like her. If she is mirroring your body language, then you are probably connecting. Perhaps she hopes that you like her back or she feels connected to you and wants you to know that she doesn’t want the same thing. If she is making lots of eye contact, this shows interest. But it could go both ways, she could be interested in knowing how you feel because you are close and she doesn’t want to hurt you, or because she likes you. A group of gestures together shows that she feels connected to you. For example, if she is smiling, she has her head titled to the side, and she is holding or touching her face at the same time, this could mean that she does like you. However, always believe what she says over any of the signals you get. Crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you. This might mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings. ;, Once you have considered how she feels and evaluated her body language, you do not have to over think her feelings for you. The truth is that you do not know for sure how she feels. And you will not know until you have asked her straight out how she feels. And believe what she says over the other signals you feel like you may be getting.Do not feel bad about what you think she feels or thinks. This is not going to help you stay confident, and it is also probably not accurate.  This will help you to know how to talk to her. If she has a crush on someone else or is with someone else, you will want to approach this conversation differently. You would know because you may have heard other people talk about it, or she may talk about it herself.If you do know she is with someone else, acknowledge it at the start of the conversation. You will need to say that you do not want to step on her relationship. Stay a little more reserved or distant in your conversation, while still remaining honest.You can ask her, do you want me to tell you about my feelings? Sometimes when a person asks a question they are not interested in hearing a sincere answer. For example, in this instance she may be trying to point out that you are acting like you like her. Being honest and straightforward in your question “do you want me to be honest?” will be the best way to deal with this possibility.Stay further away from her physically and emotionally if she is with someone. Getting close to her or being very open and honest might make her feel uncomfortable. You will want to keep your distance.  Do you know whether she is allowed to date? Some people may be interested in dating but have parents who are strict about dating rules. If you know that she isn’t allowed to date, you may want to acknowledge this fact in the conversation. Try to make her feel comfortable if she seems worried about her parents. Tell her that you do not want to step on her relationship with her parents.In this case you may not need to tell her that you have a crush on her. You can simply acknowledge that she is not allowed to date.Keep your distance physically to help her feel comfortable.","['Consider why she is asking.', 'If you have an idea about how she feels, it will help you have a more productive conversation with her.', 'We communicate mainly through our tone of voice and body language, so try to understand what is going on using these signals.', 'If she is raising her eyebrows, she might be uncomfortable.', 'This might mean that she does not want you to like her.', 'If she is mirroring your body language, then you are probably connecting.', 'Perhaps she hopes that you like her back or she feels connected to you and wants you to know that she doesn’t want the same thing.', 'If she is making lots of eye contact, this shows interest.', 'But it could go both ways, she could be interested in knowing how you feel because you are close and she doesn’t want to hurt you, or because she likes you.', 'A group of gestures together shows that she feels connected to you.', 'For example, if she is smiling, she has her head titled to the side, and she is holding or touching her face at the same time, this could mean that she does like you.', 'However, always believe what she says over any of the signals you get.', 'Crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you.', 'This might mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings.', ';, Once you have considered how she feels and evaluated her body language, you do not have to over think her feelings for you.', 'The truth is that you do not know for sure how she feels.', 'And you will not know until you have asked her straight out how she feels.', 'And believe what she says over the other signals you feel like you may be getting.', 'Do not feel bad about what you think she feels or thinks.', 'This is not going to help you stay confident, and it is also probably not accurate.', 'This will help you to know how to talk to her.', 'If she has a crush on someone else or is with someone else, you will want to approach this conversation differently.', 'You would know because you may have heard other people talk about it, or she may talk about it herself.', 'If you do know she is with someone else, acknowledge it at the start of the conversation.', 'You will need to say that you do not want to step on her relationship.', 'Stay a little more reserved or distant in your conversation, while still remaining honest.', 'You can ask her, do you want me to tell you about my feelings?', 'Sometimes when a person asks a question they are not interested in hearing a sincere answer.', 'For example, in this instance she may be trying to point out that you are acting like you like her.', 'Being honest and straightforward in your question “do you want me to be honest?” will be the best way to deal with this possibility.', 'Stay further away from her physically and emotionally if she is with someone.', 'Getting close to her or being very open and honest might make her feel uncomfortable.', 'You will want to keep your distance.', 'Do you know whether she is allowed to date?', 'Some people may be interested in dating but have parents who are strict about dating rules.', 'If you know that she isn’t allowed to date, you may want to acknowledge this fact in the conversation.', 'Try to make her feel comfortable if she seems worried about her parents.', 'Tell her that you do not want to step on her relationship with her parents.', 'In this case you may not need to tell her that you have a crush on her.', 'You can simply acknowledge that she is not allowed to date.', 'Keep your distance physically to help her feel comfortable.']"
Choose the right place. Choose the right time. Ask if you can sit down. Respect her wishes if she says no. Don’t sit too close. Sit up straight. Don’t fidget.,How to Sit Next to a Girl You Like in School1,"There are many places where sitting next to a girl that you like can be a great way to introduce yourself or get to know her further. Ideally you want to choose somewhere where you can initiate a conversation. Somewhere where she is likely to have an empty seat next to her.Sit in the desk next to her before class.Try finding a seat next to her in the cafeteria. , Timing is everything when talking to someone you have a crush on. You don’t want them to see you as a nuisance or an interruption. If the girl you like seems busy doing homework or talking to someone on her cellphone, this may not be the best time to approach her.Before or after class is a good time.Choose a seat next to her during study hall.  Show that you are courteous and thoughtful by asking her if you can sit next to her. You also want to make sure no one else has that seat claimed, like maybe a friend of hers, before you just jump into it.“Is someone already sitting in this seat?”“Do you mind if I sit here?”If it turns out she was busy, apologize for interrupting.  No woman is under any obligation to talk to you. Also, if she says this isn’t a good time or that she would rather sit alone, you’ll go further toward earning her respect by be being mindful of her wishes. Say something like, “Oh, okay. Maybe another time.” And then walk away graciously.Don’t sit down anyway if she says no.Realize that your crush may just be having a bad day or might be trying to focus on other things. Just because she said no today doesn't mean she'll say no next time.  When you sit next to your crush be sure not to intrude on their personal space. You want to be close enough so that you can easily carry on a conversation but not so close that your knees touch when you turn to face her.When choosing the desk next to your crush in class, don’t pull it closer to hers. She may find this to be an overly aggressive gesture. If you strike up a conversation and feel like the desks are too far apart to continue comfortably, you may want to slide it over a bit, but generally you should just leave it where it is.If you take a seat next to her on a bench, like on the playground or at a table in the lunch room, leave several inches between you.  Don’t slouch. Sit with your spine straight and your shoulders back. Keep your head up. You might want to turn your body slightly so that you are facing your crush more directly.Maintaining good posture will not only make you look more confident, it can increase your energy level and actually affect your hormones, making it more likely that you’ll be positive and clear headed while you speak.  Tapping your fingers on the desk, shaking your legs, or constantly readjusting your glasses will just make you look nervous. It will also act as a distraction for your crush which will make it hard for her to focus on what you have to say.Take deep breathes.Fold your hands and rest them on the desk or table in front of you. If there is no table, rest them in your lap.You don’t have to keep your hands still the whole time. Many of us use our hands to gesture while we speak, but when they are idle, keeping them folded will help keep you from fidgeting too much.Take a quick inventory of your body every few minutes.

"Ask her if you two can talk somewhere. Ask her where she would be comfortable having the conversation. Look her in the eye and say “Yes, I do have a crush on you.” Once you have had a minute and you are situated you can own how you feel, and be confident. Ask her how she feels. Respond with honesty and kindness. Talk about what you should do about your feelings. Follow up with her about the conversation later.",How to Respond to Your Crush Asking You if You Like Her2,"If you feel like she genuinely wants to know how you feel, you may want to have this conversation somewhere quiet. Think about going to a place where you can talk uninterrupted. You want to have this conversation in a space where you are comfortable to talk about how you feel openly.]]This can be a great opportunity to show her how cool you are regardless of why she is asking. If you can tell her how you feel and remain cool, calm, and collected, she will respect you all the more.Going on a walk can be a good option for a conversation like this. Walking can take away some of the awkwardness involved in the conversation. Walking is great because you are moving, not sitting and looking at each other.Going to a restaurant or coffee shop can also work if it is not busy. If you can find a secluded table to sit at or a table outside, this can be ideal.Go to a park. Sit on the swings or find a bench where the two of you can talk.  In order to show her that you respect her space and boundaries, ask her to decide where you should go. If she does not have a preference, then you can suggest places to go. Be careful not to try to force her to feel the same way. Say that you like her in a way that is free of further implication. Free of implication means that you are not communicating a different message through your body language or tone.For example, do not look very intently at her in a way that asks her to like you back. Or do not lean forward into her space unless you know that she likes you.You could ask her how she feels before you say anything. However, it is more attractive and confident if you own how you feel and speak first.  She has asked you about your crush on her, and you can absolutely ask why she wants to know. Simply ask “why are you asking?” Do not assume that you know why she is asking.Once again, keep your tone and body language free of implication. Do not suggest that you know why she is asking with a flirty or accusing tone.Focus fully on what she is saying. Show interest, nod, smile and communicate that you understand through your body language and noises. Try not to interrupt her. Let her speak her piece. You can ask for clarification later. Give her feedback about what she said. You can say ""so what I hear you say is ..."". This will let her know that you really listened and that you want to understand her. Do not be judgmental about what she is saying. This is how she feels and although it may involve you, do not take her feelings personally. Read on to the next method for more on not taking it personally.  If she likes you back, you can tell her “I’m so excited that you like me too!” If she does not like you back, you can tell her honestly “I’m sad that you do not like me, but I appreciate that you told me.”You can also thank her for being brave enough to bring up the conversation.If she does not like you, do not make her feel bad for not liking you. Even if you honestly feel like she should like you, it is not your place to tell her that or make her feel that way.  If she doesn’t feel the same way, you might want to ask her if she still wants to be friends. If you do not feel like you two can be friends, ask if you can have space. If she does like you, ask her whether she would like to start dating.Try not to assume what will happen between you two if she says she has a crush on you, too. Instead, communicate with her how she feels about dating.If you want to start dating, ask her about what dating means to her and explain what dating means to you. You want to make sure that you are talking about the same thing. You may also want to discuss relationship expectations you have and ask her about her's. This may be a full conversation in itself, and one you come back to periodically.  Because it can be an awkward conversation, you may want to avoid talking about it. However, embrace the awkwardness and be confident. If you are still friends but she does not like you, you can simply tell her “thanks for having that conversation with me; I appreciated it.”You can also follow up over text message, but keep it brief.

Have some ideas about what to talk about. Introduce yourself. Compliment her. Listen and ask questions. Pay attention to her body language.,How to Sit Next to a Girl You Like in School2,"Talking to a girl you like can be nerve-racking. You can ease some of the stress by having a few things already picked out to talk about before you sit down. If you are in the same class you could say something about the teacher or the content of the class itself. If you are at lunch or out with friends you might mention a popular movie or the antics of a friend you have in common.“Professor Fink is so boring. I actually like physics, but he has a real knack for sucking all the fun out of it.”“Have you seen the latest episode of Supernatural? It was riveting.”“Today is my dog’s birthday. I’m so excited. Do you have any pets?”, If you don’t already know the girl you like, introduce yourself as soon as you sit down. Tell her your name and maybe what you think of the class. Just a few sentences. “I’m Steven. I usually sit over by the Coke machine at lunch, but I thought I’d switch it up today.”, When delivered with the right intentions, a sincere compliment can make anyone feel good. Avoid saying things about her body or comments that are lewd or sexual. Instead, tell her you like her shirt or her earrings. Even better, compliment her ideas while you guys are talking.Be honest. An insincere compliment is usually easy to pick out and can have the opposite effect.“I really like listening to you break down the thematic elements of the latest episode of Supernatural. It’s opening up the show in a new way for me.”“Those are really nice earrings. Where did you get them?”Avoid sexually charged compliments.  Don’t just monopolize the conversation. Sitting next to some you like is a great way to get to know them better. Ask her about herself. What kinds of things is she into? How is she liking the class so far? What does she usually like to get for lunch from the cafeteria?If this is a first meeting, keep the questions light. Avoid extremely personal questions.Smile and nod your head. Say things like, “I see.” “Yes.” or “I Understand.” Make eye contact. This helps you appear confident. It also assures her that you are listening when she speaks and that you are engaged in what she has to say.  If she is avoiding eye contact or leaning away from you, these may be indicators that she is not into the conversation. You can try redirecting the topic to something more neutral or inline with her interests. This may also be a sign that she needs more space or is feeling somehow intruded on. Try leaning back or scooting over a bit to give her more room.If you notice her leaning forward, smiling, and/or making eye contact, then this is a good indicator that she is engaged in the conversation and having a good time.

Know when to stop talking. Practice good hygiene. Tell her it was nice to meet her. Ask if she would like to talk again.,How to Sit Next to a Girl You Like in School3,"When class starts or an assembly in the gym begins, don’t try to keep the conversation going in a whisper. Instead, participate fully in whatever the activity is. This will show her that you have very clear boundaries and that you understand social norms.You may be able to make a few more connections with some non verbal communication. If the teacher says something funny, you might look her way and make some eye contact while you laugh.  You’ll want to be at your best when you sit next to a person you like. The last thing you want is to come off charming and likable, only to have her become too distracted by any offensive odors coming from your body. Be sure to shower daily. Where deodorant and brush your teeth twice a day.Carry mints with you. Have one before you sit down. Gum can work too, but it can sometimes be hard to talk while chewing gum. It can also be perceived as rude or gross.Where a modest amount of cologne. Don’t dump too much on. It shouldn’t burn the nostrils of the person smelling it. A few dabs on your neck and wrists is fine.  End the conversation by thank her for her time. Tell her you really enjoyed meeting her (or getting to know her even better). Be specific. Reference something you guys talked about. “I had a really great time hearing your views on the television show Supernatural.” “Thank you for telling me that funny story about your cats.” “I understand this physics problem so much better now that we’ve had a chance to talk it out together.  If you’ve just met, it might not be prudent to ask for her number right away. But you can try to set up an appropriate time to meet again. Or even better, ask if it would be okay if you sat next to her the next time the class meets. After you get to know her a little better, you can ask to call her sometime.Be specific here as well. “I’d like to talk more about pet ownership with you if you are interested.”Let her know when you’ll be here again.

Let her see you having a good time. Be a gentleman. Wow her with your confidence. Be independent. Be a little bit mysterious. Be good at something. Don’t show off too much. Put some effort into your appearance. Treat others with respect. Don't take yourself too seriously. Actually listen to her. Flirt with her. Make her friends think you’re awesome. Make her feel special. Just remember to play hard to get. Check in on her occasionally. Don’t overthink it.,How to Make Girls Crazy for You,"There’s nothing a girl wants more than a guy who is obviously enjoying himself and completely happy on his own. When you’re with your friends, enjoy laughing and sharing stories. When you’re walking to class, think happy thoughts that put a smile on your face. When you see her, show her that you’re in a good mood, and that you’re not a total downer. You don’t have to fake it, obviously, but you should let her see that you’re a person who is enjoying himself so she wants to be in your orbit.If she sees you already having a great time, then she’ll want to be a part of what you have to offer. If she thinks you need a girl to have a good time, then she’ll think that you’re not quite happy with yourself. , Gentlemen are all too hard to come by these days and if you are one, girls will take notice. You don’t have to wear a stuffy suit or act all formal just to show a basic courtesy to women. To be a gentleman, treat women with respect by opening doors for them, caring about how they’re feeling when you’re around them, and generally not being too vulgar or burping or being crude in their presence. Every girl wants to be treated like a lady, and you don’t want to make it feel forced to be a real gentleman.Many guys you know may not have the greatest manners or politeness skills. Stand out from the pack by having good manners and by being polite both to the girl and the people around you.  Girls love confident guys and naturally gravitate towards them. If you want the girl to really go crazy for you, then you have to let her see how much you love being who you are. Be happy to just be in the moment, enjoy the time you spend with your friends, and just let her see that you’re happy and secure with the person who you are and that you don’t care about what other people think. Many guys are obviously insecure and girls don’t like that; they don’t want to spend their time building you up. If you’re happy with who you are, then the girl will be much more likely to want to be around you.This doesn’t mean that you have to love every last thing about yourself. It does mean that you should be aware of your flaws, trying to change the ones you can change, and accepting the ones you can’t.You don’t have to act overly macho or brag about how awesome you are to come off as truly confident. In fact, this will be a turn-off for girls.  Though girls need guys who have time for them, they don’t want guys who have nothing going on except them, either. If you want the girl to go crazy for you, then you have to impress her with how cool and independent you are. You should be happy doing your own thing, whether it’s playing your guitar on the quad or going for a run in the park. If you’re a follower and just try to do what everyone else is doing because you can’t think for yourself, then she’ll be able to tell. Instead, impress her with your ability to think for yourself and to be comfortable on your own.Though a girl wants a guy who can have a great time in a crowd, she doesn’t want someone who is completely bored on his own, either.  Don’t open up to her about every little thing you’re thinking right away. As you get to know the girl, sure, you can reveal a little bit about yourself, but at first, you don’t have to tell her about how much you love your dog Munchkin, or about your fight with your best friend. Let her see that it’s worth it to get to know you because it’ll make you open up, little by little. If she thinks it’s too easy to get to know you, then she won’t see you as a challenge. While you don’t have to lie to her or make up excuses to be mysterious, you should avoid telling her everything all at one.If you have to go, don’t tell her that you have to go meet your mom. Leave her to wonder about your plans.  Nothing makes girls go crazier than a guy who is great a guitar, who has an amazing singing voice, or who is unstoppable when it comes to basketball. To put it bluntly, talent is hot. If you want to amaze and impress a girl, then yeah, it helps if you’re really good at something. That doesn’t mean that you should brag about it or show off in front of her or anything. It just means that you should work to be really good at something and lead her to find out about it.Of course, you shouldn’t just pursue an activity or a passion just to impress girls, but because you care about it. Being really good at something will also boost your self-esteem, which will also be great for impressing the girls.  Stop thinking that the only way a girl will go crazy for you is if you keep bragging and talking about how awesome you are at various activities. If you really are great at something, then she’ll get word of it; if you feel like you have to tell her, then it means that you’re insecure and feel like you have to convince people about how amazing you are. You can talk about the things you love to do, but don’t say things like, “I’m the best at…” or, “I just killed it when…” or the girl will get bored and will start rolling her eyes.If you’re always showing off and talking about how awesome you are, then girls will start to see you as social poison. Nobody wants to be around guys who are always talking about themselves.  This doesn't mean you have to spend all of your spare time at the gym working on those guns. It does mean that you should make an effort to think about how you look before you step out of the house, making sure you're showered, smell nice, have well-fitting clothes, and that you don't look super scruffy (unless that's part of your look). If you look like you just rolled out of bed, then the girl will wonder why she should spend time caring about you if you barely care about yourself. You don't need to look like a model to show a girl that you've made an effort to look decent.If you're hanging out with a girl, it's common courtesy to show up looking nice. Otherwise, she'll take your lack of effort personally.  If you want a girl to go crazy for you, then you have to actually have a reputation for being a nice person. This doesn't mean you should let people walk all over you or that you should be nice to people who are mean to you, but it does mean that you should treat everyone around you, from the less cool kids in your school to your teachers or the girl who works at your local grocery store, with a base level of respect. Don't just be nice to the cool people and treat everyone else like dirt; treat all of the people around you like equals and girls will be impressed that you're a good person with a kind heart.Contrary to what you think, putting people down and gossiping won't really win girls over. If you're always being negative about or to other people, then the girls will feel like they can't really trust you.  Girls love guys who can make them laugh, and who are comfortable enough with themselves to be able to make jokes at their own expense. This doesn't mean you have to sound insecure or self-deprecating, but if you find an opportunity to poke fun at yourself and to make her laugh in the process, then go for it. She'll think it's cool that you're not obsessing over impressing her or making her think you're perfect, and she'll begin to open up to you and want to be around you more.If you get easily offended or mad when anyone else pokes fun at you, you'll come off as insecure and defensive. Learn to take a joke, and the ladies will be impressed.  One of the biggest mistakes guys make is to spend so much time talking about themselves or worrying about themselves that they never stop and realize that there’s a girl standing in front of them. You may even make the innocent mistake of thinking too hard about what to say to impress a girl to have the time to consider what she’s saying to you. That stops now. Instead, take the time to really listen to her, to let her finish talking instead of interrupting, and to make an effort to really understand what she’s trying to say instead of trying to relate everything back to yourself.It’s really hard for girls to find a good listener. If you can be a good listener, this will definitely make you stand out as someone who genuinely cares for her.  A little bit of flirting can go a long way. If you want to get the ladies, then you have to know how to flirt with them without going over the top. Just be fun and light and playful, making harmless jokes and teasing them a little bit, and keep the conversation and banter going in a fun, lighthearted way. Don’t make overly sexual comments or insult the girl when you’re really just trying to tease her; instead, give her cute compliments and even laugh at yourself a little bit to make her see that you like her and don’t take the whole flirting thing too seriously.Of course, if you want one special girl, you should give her most of your flirting energy while occasionally flirting with others to keep it interesting; you don’t want her to think that you’re just a big flirt who flirts with everybody and doesn’t really care about her.  If you want the girl to go crazy over you, then it helps a lot if her friends think you’re the best thing since sliced bread. If you’re only nice to the girl you like and are kind of mean to the rest of her friends, then she’ll get word of it and will think that you don’t really care about people. But if you charm her friends, without flirting with them or giving them the wrong idea, then she’ll get word of how nice of a guy you are, and will undoubtedly like you even more.When girls hear other girls talking about how awesome a guy is, then they get jealous, which makes them like that guy even more.  If you want a girl to go crazy for you, then you have to make her feel special by actually taking the time to recognize her as a unique individual. Tell her, “You’re not like other girls…” or “You’re so different from your friends…” and make her see that she really does stand out to you. You can give her a specific compliment about her personality or mention something she said in a previous conversation to show that you’re listening and that you do care. Don’t do this to every girl, though, or it will get back to her, and it’ll look like you’re just a player. Girls want to feel unique, and if they can find a guy who makes them feel that way, they’ll be all in.Take the time to really notice the things that make the girl stand out, whether it’s her confidence, her laugh, or her talent at dancing. Let her know why she’s special.  Though you want to win the girl over, you have to keep up the chase. You don’t want her to think that she has you in the palm of her hand, but that she has to do some work to win you over, too. It should be a mutual thing. Let her know you like her, but don’t shower her with compliments. Hang out with her, but make sure you have plans with other friends, too, and that you aren’t available the second she wants to hang out. If she calls you, stop picking up the second the phone rings; you’ve got other things to do, right? This will keep the girl interested in coming back for more.This doesn’t mean that you have to play elaborate games to win the girl over. It does mean that you should keep things interesting so there’s never a dull moment when she sees you. If you put it all out there, she’ll be less likely to be crazy about the intriguing, awesome guy that you are.  You don't want to become that obsessive possessive guy every girl is afraid of, but you also don't want to be Mr. Aloof. Whether you're in a relationship with a girl or just starting to hang out, texting her every once in a while to ask how her day is going or to ask how her math test or soccer game went will show that you're thinking about her even when you're not together. This will make her see that you're a guy worth keeping around. Just make sure that you're not always the one to check in first or she may feel a bit smothered.Don't text her to say hi more than once every other day or so. You don't want her to think that you have nothing better to do than to be in touch with her.  The best way to win a girl over is not to rush it and just to enjoy the moment instead of trying to find the best fifty ways to be the coolest guy ever. As corny as it sounds, at the end of the day, you want the girl to like you, not some overdone, fake version of who you are, so you should focus on having the girl get to know the real you and getting to know the real her in the process.If you spend all your time trying to impress the girl, trying to play hard to get, or generally behaving in a way that just doesn't feel natural to you, then she'll catch on pretty fast. Instead, relax, charm the girl, and get ready for her to go crazy for you.","['There’s nothing a girl wants more than a guy who is obviously enjoying himself and completely happy on his own.', 'When you’re with your friends, enjoy laughing and sharing stories.', 'When you’re walking to class, think happy thoughts that put a smile on your face.', 'When you see her, show her that you’re in a good mood, and that you’re not a total downer.', 'You don’t have to fake it, obviously, but you should let her see that you’re a person who is enjoying himself so she wants to be in your orbit.', 'If she sees you already having a great time, then she’ll want to be a part of what you have to offer.', 'If she thinks you need a girl to have a good time, then she’ll think that you’re not quite happy with yourself.', ', Gentlemen are all too hard to come by these days and if you are one, girls will take notice.', 'You don’t have to wear a stuffy suit or act all formal just to show a basic courtesy to women.', 'To be a gentleman, treat women with respect by opening doors for them, caring about how they’re feeling when you’re around them, and generally not being too vulgar or burping or being crude in their presence.', 'Every girl wants to be treated like a lady, and you don’t want to make it feel forced to be a real gentleman.', 'Many guys you know may not have the greatest manners or politeness skills.', 'Stand out from the pack by having good manners and by being polite both to the girl and the people around you.', 'Girls love confident guys and naturally gravitate towards them.', 'If you want the girl to really go crazy for you, then you have to let her see how much you love being who you are.', 'Be happy to just be in the moment, enjoy the time you spend with your friends, and just let her see that you’re happy and secure with the person who you are and that you don’t care about what other people think.', 'Many guys are obviously insecure and girls don’t like that;

Smile at her. Talk to her. Compliment her.,How to Make a Girl Smile1,"Often it’s as easy as making eye contact and smiling to get a girl to smile back. If it doesn’t work, keep trying, and you might get a smile yet. You might even try a sillier smile to see if it might make her laugh. Smiling is a good way to open up a conversation, because it makes both you and her happier.When you smile, it literally changes chemicals in your brain, making you feel happier, and smiles are catching. That means, when someone sees a smile, they want to smile, too, making them happier. , Ask questions about her and what she likes. Find things you have in common. By discovering what you both like, she might see you in a different way than before. And she'll smile because it shows that you enjoy talking to her. It also sets you up with ideas of what to do in the future.  Everyone likes to hear nice things about themselves, and so, a compliment is sure to make her smile. The best compliments are sincere, which means you really mean it. Take a moment to study her, so you can tell her what you really do like about her. You don't have to stick to looks. You can also compliment her brains, her brilliant smile, or her sparkling wit.For example, you could say, ""The dress looks good on you!""You could also say, ""You know, you're really smart! You always seem to have the right answer in class.""Another option is, ""You have the best hair!

Make sure you have her attention first. Poke fun of yourself. Crack a joke. Be silly. Try a silly dance.,How to Make a Girl Smile2,"You can't make someone laugh if they're not paying any attention to you. Make sure you have her attention before you try anything funny, such as walking up to her and saying ""Hello"" or making eye contact with her.  Poking fun at yourself shows you don’t take yourself too seriously, and that’s an attractive quality. Plus, any time you can crack a joke, even at your own expense, will help to make a girl smile, and it can help lighten up any tension in the room that may be the cause of the girl's frown.This type of humor works especially well when you do something a little silly or clumsy. For instance, if you trip over your shoelaces when she's around, you could say, ""If only someone had taught me to tie my shoes, I wouldn't be in this situation.""It can also work if she does something clumsy. You can take the attention off her by poking fun at yourself. For instance, you could say, ""That wasn't clumsy. Let me tell you about clumsy. One time, I tripped on my own shoe and went tumbling down the stairs. Now THAT was clumsy. What you just did was just cute."", Cracking a joke shows you have some confidence. Not every joke is going to be a winner, but just the attempt can make her smile. Some of the main ingredients of a good joke include finding the right target, having the element of surprise, exaggerating everyday life, and having the basis of truth.The ""target"" refers to what you tell the joke about. When telling a joke to someone, the target should be relevant to their interests. For instance, telling a combat joke to a teenage girl may not make much sense, since she's (likely) never been in combat.The surprise is the twist to the joke that makes it funny. Exaggerating makes it funny because it takes it beyond the every day while still keeping an element of truth.For example, if you're eating together in the cafeteria, try cracking a joke about the food. You could say something like, ""This food is so terrible my dog would turn up his nose at it."", Even in junior high and high school, being silly can make people smile or laugh. You can try silly voices, or you can attempt an impression of someone famous. You could even employ some slapstick humor, such as ""accidentally"" spraying yourself with the water fountain by holding your thumb over the stream. However, slapstick could backfire if the girl just finds it ridiculous.Think about what makes you or your friends laugh, as she'll likely find some of the same things funny.  Another way to make to make someone laugh is to do a silly dance. Of course, you don't want to just run up to a girl and start doing a gorilla a dance. However, if you're standing near her, and some music came on, you could start doing a silly dance in time to the music.","[""You can't make someone laugh if they're not paying any attention to you."", 'Make sure you have her attention before you try anything funny, such as walking up to her and saying ""Hello"" or making eye contact with her.', 'Poking fun at yourself shows you don’t take yourself too seriously, and that’s an attractive quality.', ""Plus, any time you can crack a joke, even at your own expense, will help to make a girl smile, and it can help lighten up any tension in the room that may be the cause of the girl's frown."", 'This type of humor works especially well when you do something a little silly or clumsy.', 'For instance, if you trip over your shoelaces when she\'s around, you could say, ""If only someone had taught me to tie my shoes, I wouldn\'t be in this situation.', '""It can also work if she does something clumsy.', 'You can take the attention off her by poking fun at yourself.', 'For instance, you could say, ""That wasn\'t clumsy.', 'Let me tell you about clumsy.', 'One time, I tripped on my own shoe and went tumbling down the stairs.', 'Now THAT was clumsy.', 'What you just did was just cute."", Cracking a joke shows you have some confidence.', 'Not every joke is going to be a winner, but just the attempt can make her smile.', 'Some of the main ingredients of a good joke include finding the right target, having the element of surprise, exaggerating everyday life, and having the basis of truth.', 'The ""target"" refers to what you tell the joke about.', 'When telling a joke to someone, the target should be relevant to their interests.', ""For instance, telling a combat joke to a teenage girl may not make much sense, since she's (likely) never been in combat."", 'The surprise is the twist to the joke that makes it funny.', 'Exaggerating makes it funny because it takes it beyond the every day while still keeping an element of truth.', ""For example, if you're eating together in the cafeteria, try cracking a joke about the food."", 'You could say something like, ""This food is so terrible my dog would turn up his nose at it."", Even in junior high and high school, being silly can make people smile or laugh.', 'You can try silly voices, or you can attempt an impression of someone famous.', 'You could even employ some slapstick humor, such as ""accidentally"" spraying yourself with the water fountain by holding your thumb over the stream.', 'However, slapstick could backfire if the girl just finds it ridiculous.', ""Think about what makes you or your friends laugh, as she'll likely find some of the same things funny."", 'Another way to make to make someone laugh is to do a silly dance.', ""Of course, you don't want to just run up to a girl and start doing a gorilla a dance."", ""However, if you're standing near her, and some music came on, you could start doing a silly dance in time to the music.""]"
Stay in touch. Be there for her. Tease her or play with her. Apologize when you've done something wrong.,How to Make a Girl Smile3,"Text her fun messages or leave her voice messages to wake up to in the morning. Sending her little messages lets her know you're thinking about her and makes her feel loved and supported. It's sure to put a smile on her face.  When she lets you know that she needs or wants your help, make sure you are there. If she's upset, make sure you provide a shoulder to cry on. When you say you'll do something, make sure you're there. If you make a date with her, show up on time and be genuine about it. If she knows you are true to your word and a person she can depend on, she'll definitely smile more.  You could lightly arm wrestle with her or tickle her, too. Not in a mean way, but in a cute way that allows her to realize you want to share a special connection with her. Try holding her hand or hugging her by surprise. However, if she pulls back, make sure to let her go, as she may not want to be touched right then.  That's it, you've done it again. You've done something wrong, and now you're girlfriend's mad.

Only then will you have a smiling girlfriend again (eventually).For instance, just saying, ""OK, I'm sorry,"" isn't going to cut it. Rather, you should say something like, ""I'm sorry I forgot to meet you after school. I know I made you wait around for me, and that sucks for you.

Make her something. Show you’re listening. Give her a gift. Take her on a surprise outing.,How to Make a Girl Smile4,"Nothing says you’re interested in her more than taking the time to make her something. It could be something as small as a bouquet of wildflowers you picked yourself and put in a homemade vase. Really, it's the thought and the surprise that count. You could also make her a braided bracelet out of yarn or beads. Another option is baking her something, like a batch of cookies or brownies.  If she talks about a particular band that you’ve never heard, find it and listen to it. She will probably be impressed that you went to the trouble of listening to it. Bring her things she mentions. If she said she likes coffee, bring her coffee one day. Show her that you are getting to know the real girl, and her likes and dislikes. Also, pay attention when she tells a story. It says something about her, and she'll be touched if you remember it later.  It doesn’t have to be big, but it should be thoughtful. She should know that you’ve been thinking about her. It should also show that you know the kinds of things she likes and likes to do. In other words, it should be thoughtful.If she collects things, like stickers, pins, pens, or hair bows, bring her a new one that you know she'll like.If she likes to read, pick a used book to give to her.You could also bring her a piece of chocolate or her favorite soda.  It doesn’t have to be fancy, just something that will be new and surprising and bring a smile to her face. Think about the kinds of activities she likes, and come up with a plan. In fact, you could even ask some questions to figure out what she likes, without giving away the surprise, such as, ""So what are some of your favorite restaurants in town? I love Betty's Burgers.""Visit a free art gallery, or go have coffee and dessert at a coffee shop.Take a walk by the lake to feed the ducks.Join a free dancing lesson, or go browse the library together.","['Nothing says you’re interested in her more than taking the time to make her something.', 'It could be something as small as a bouquet of wildflowers you picked yourself and put in a homemade vase.', ""Really, it's the thought and the surprise that count."", 'You could also make her a braided bracelet out of yarn or beads.', 'Another option is baking her something, like a batch of cookies or brownies.', 'If she talks about a particular band that you’ve never heard, find it and listen to it.', 'She will probably be impressed that you went to the trouble of listening to it.', 'Bring her things she mentions.', 'If she said she likes coffee, bring her coffee one day.', 'Show her that you are getting to know the real girl, and her likes and dislikes.', 'Also, pay attention when she tells a story.', ""It says something about her, and she'll be touched if you remember it later."", 'It doesn’t have to be big, but it should be thoughtful.', 'She should know that you’ve been thinking about her.', 'It should also show that you know the kinds of things she likes and likes to do.', 'In other words, it should be thoughtful.', ""If she collects things, like stickers, pins, pens, or hair bows, bring her a new one that you know she'll like."", 'If she likes to read, pick a used book to give to her.', 'You could also bring her a piece of chocolate or her favorite soda.', 'It doesn’t have to be fancy, just something that will be new and surprising and bring a smile to her face.', 'Think about the kinds of activities she likes, and come up with a plan.', 'In fact, you could even ask some questions to figure out what she likes, without giving away the surprise, such as, ""So what are some of your favorite restaurants in town?', ""I love Betty's Burgers."", '""Visit a free art gallery, or go have coffee and dessert at a coffee shop.', 'Take a walk by the lake to feed the ducks.', 'Join a free dancing lesson, or go browse the library together.']"
Gain a girl’s trust in the same ways you gain it from anyone. Assume she’s been let down before. Be clear with your intentions. Be true to yourself. Follow through on your promises. Be appropriately affectionate. Communicate with trust. Don’t take it for granted. Come clean but don’t obsess over the details. Apologize unconditionally. Forgive yourself. Be patient and understanding. Work together.,How to Make a Girl Trust You,"Gaining the trust of the girl you like, of the old friend you’ve let down, or of the husband you’ve betrayed are not all that different. Assuming that girls / young women have special requirements for gaining trust can easily devolve into stereotyping and unfair generalizations. Instead, universal advice like that provided by How to Build Trust makes a good starting point for anyone. In it, the basic requirements for earning trust include:Being reliable.Being honest.Being open.Showing integrity.More specific ideas about how to get a girl to trust you should draw from basic building blocks like these. , There’s a good chance that the old saying “once bitten, twice shy” may apply to your girl. At some point, she’s probably had her trust betrayed by someone important to her, and therefore may be hesitant to take the chance of being hurt again.Don’t take it personally if she is hesitant to trust you because of past disappointments. Accept the challenge to work even harder to earn her trust.For instance, getting help from “references” — mutual friends or acquaintances who can speak to your trustworthiness — may help you break through the walls of skepticism created by previous betrayals. Gather as much evidence as possible that you can be trusted, but expect your own words and actions to be most important.  It is always easier to trust someone who is clear and unequivocal about his intentions, be it in business, in love, or in life.Evasiveness or deception about your real interest in a girl will make it easy for her to withhold her trust. In relationship terms, be up-front about whether you are just seeking some short-term fun, hope for something more lasting, or simply aren’t sure where you see things heading.If you have any genuine care or respect for that girl you met at a party, for example, don’t lead her on by saying you’re interested in a long-term relationship if you are not. Show trust in her by being honest from the start, and you’ll be more likely to earn her trust in return.  Don’t try to be someone you are not in order to draw the interest of a girl, and then expect to be able to gain her trust. Even if you manage to “fool” her temporarily, she will eventually see through this fabrication, and then it will be nearly impossible to earn her trust after you have deceived her right from the start.Be confident in who you are, and expect that to be good enough to score her affections and, eventually, her trust. It is much easier to trust someone who looks, talks, and acts like someone who is comfortable in his or her “own skin.” If you know you are trustworthy, she will eventually see it too.  Reliability is always a critical factor in building trust, whether from a co-worker or a romantic interest. She needs to believe you’ll do what you say you’ll do (and not do what you say you won’t), each and every time. That is the kind of person who is easy to trust.Be consistent in what you say and do. If you say you’ll pick her up at 7 o’clock, do it. If you promise to drop a bad habit that bothers her, work as hard as you can to do so. Her trust will be the reward for your efforts.  Lots of girls out there (and guys, for that matter) appreciate an unsolicited hug, a hand to hold, a gentle kiss, or a shoulder to cry on. Proving that you understand her wants and needs, and that you are always “there for her,” will put you on the fast track toward earning her trust.Of course, realizing that she isn’t a hugger, or showing that you know and accept her current limits on the physical nature of your relationship, can also build trust. Sometimes what you don’t do is just as important as what you do in order to gain trust. If she feels like you don’t understand her, or are pressuring her to move things forward, she is more likely to withhold her trust.  Trust is almost impossible to build without regular, open, and honest communication. Prove yourself to be an active, involved, and interested listener, and speak to her thoughtfully and truthfully about your feelings, and you will slowly but surely gain her trust.In the business world, people have found that certain simple, direct phrases tend to help build trust with co-workers or clients. The same concept holds true in personal relationships as well. Phrases like “thank you,” “yes,” “I will,” “What do you think?”, “I trust your judgment,” and “I understand” are unequivocal and demonstrate a focus on the other person’s needs.  It turns out that trust is a lot like everyone’s favorite nursery rhyme egg, Humpty Dumpty: it’s easy to break, and very hard to rebuild afterward.Once you’ve betrayed a girl’s trust, “all the king’s horses and all the king’s men” may not be enough to get it back. Sometimes you’ll just have to accept that it is lost forever. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try your hardest to earn it back.Never assume that you deserve a second chance, especially if you have seriously betrayed her trust, such as by cheating on her. Earning trust is hard, and re-earning it is that much more difficult. Don’t fool yourself about the substantial effort it will take on your part, and the reality that it may not be enough not matter what you do.  The first step to regaining trust is always to be completely honest (to her and to yourself) about what you did to lose it in the first place. Think long and hard about why you did the thing that broke her trust, and be prepared to patiently answer her questions and accept her anger and sadness.Never try to downplay what you have done to break her trust. It is serious business, and you need to always treat it as such if you want any shot at regaining her trust. That said, once you’ve “come clean,” try not to obsess over why you did it or the “gory details.” At some point, both of you have to be able to move forward if trust is to be rebuilt. You can’t control her pace in moving past it, but you can control yours.  Never make excuses for your indiscretions that have caused a loss of trust. You screwed up, it was your fault and yours alone, and now it is up to you to do everything you can to rebuild what your actions have broken. As with coming clean with all the details, a full apology is necessary to “clean the slate” before you can begin working to restore trust.Saying “Sorry I messed up. I promise I won’t do it again” will not cut it. Try something more like: “I am very sorry that I lied to you about something so important. I know how much it has hurt you, and it is all my fault. I hope you will give the the chance to earn your forgiveness and regain your trust, even if I don’t deserve it right now.”, Sometimes people can become so focused on admitting their errors and begging for forgiveness that they never get around to forgiving themselves. We all make stupid mistakes, and hurt people we care about. Without minimizing the seriousness of what you’ve done, you need to be able to accept it and leave it behind if you hope to move forward. If you can’t get past it, she’ll definitely never be able to.Regaining trust is hard work, and requires you to make real changes in your life. If you’re too busy still punishing yourself for screwing up, you won’t be able to put the work in that is necessary to regain her trust.Remember, you can’t take back what you’ve done. All you can do is try to make amends for it and prove that you’ve learned from this mistake and won’t repeat it.  Earning forgiveness and regaining trust take time, and they have to happen at the pace set by the person who has been harmed. Your actions and words will help determine if the process succeeds, but you can’t force things along. Sometimes, all you can do is wait and hope.Expect setbacks in the process. Things may seem like they are going well, and then all of a sudden she can’t stand to look at you again. The truth is that the sting of a betrayal is never going to completely vanish, and like any old injury, you have to accept that the pain is going to “flare up” every so often, and sometimes for no apparent reason.  You broke her trust, and you have to do much of the heavy lifting in order to stand a chance of getting it back. However, she has to be willing to put in the effort as well. Only by working together can trust be restored. If she can’t or won’t join you in making the effort to rebuild things, take that as a sign that the break is irreparable.If open and honest communication is important to building trust, it is even more vital to rebuilding it. Be willing to talk and listen a lot. Don’t hold back, and encourage her to do the same. Consider engaging the help of a therapist or counselor trained in dealing with broken relationships. If she raises the idea, never hesitate to agree. If it’s your idea, give her the time and space to consider it.","['Gaining the trust of the girl you like, of the old friend you’ve let down, or of the husband you’ve betrayed are not all that

Tropical resorts or festive cities on the other hand attract singles in droves. , Because most everyone going will be single, a singles cruise will vastly increase your chance to striking up conversation with single women.Conceivably, meeting someone on any cruise ship would be a romantic experience, but due to the fact that cruises are regularly associated with couples, your bet luck will be had with singles cruises.

"Sharpen up your social skills in the months prior. Dress appropriately.Looking good is an important part of meeting and attracting women no matter where you are. Stay busy. Act friendly.Above all, it doesn't hurt your chances to be sincerely friendly towards people while you're out on vacation. Carry something to share with others.If you carry something as simple as a pack of smokes or playing cards, you'll have a physical proper conversations with.",How to Meet a Girl on a Vacation2,"You will have the highest chances of success dating on vacation if you plan for it well in advance. Look up the customs and social norms of the culture you're visiting, and work on your charm. Although a lot of this is easier said than done, it can be accomplished with the right degree of self-awareness. Go out and be social in your own area first; don't wait for a vacation to turn on the charm.Don't throw money at so-called pickup artists and dating coaches. Although some of the basic information may be helpful, it's seldom worth the exorbitant rates many of the coaches charge for their services.  Although your dress should be relatively casual and applicable to the vacation setting, you should emphasize appearance over pure comfort.A collared shirt and dress shoes work well for the majority of cases.  No matter what, stay busy during your vacation. Although some people take a vacation as an opportunity to laze about, you'll only have a realistic chance of meeting new people when you're out actively doing things. Check the weekly schedule for the resort you're staying at. Read up on the events that are happening nearby. If your resort has a bar or club, check it out and see what's going on. Just about any event will provide an opportunity to meet women, so you should take up any opportunity when it presents itself.Check out party events in the area.Parties entail a high-energy environment that's perfect for meeting single women.Meeting women during the day increases your chances as opposed to the night. Because people will be relaxing throughout the day while on vacation, you'll have more time to spend with a girl than if you were saving your advances purely for the night. Most guys will only approach at night, which also has the effect of increasing your competition.  You should be honest and authentic. Even if a prospect doesn't share your postal code, she'll most likely be able to tell if you're being disingenuous towards her.This includes lots of smiling. Just make sure not to stare at one girl for too long. This runs the risk of being interpreted as creepiness.  For instance, if you have a decent grasp of magic tricks using playing cards, you can approach a group of girls and ask if they would like to see a trick. Some girls may even approach you for a cigarette if they see you smoking.Sunscreen is also handy, as most vacationers will be in want of it if they're spending much time on the beach.","['You will have the highest chances of success dating on vacation if you plan for it well in advance.', ""Look up the customs and social norms of the culture you're visiting, and work on your charm."", 'Although a lot of this is easier said than done, it can be accomplished with the right degree of self-awareness.', ""Go out and be social in your own area first; don't wait for a vacation to turn on the charm."", ""Don't throw money at so-called pickup artists and dating coaches."", ""Although some of the basic information may be helpful, it's seldom worth the exorbitant rates many of the coaches charge for their services."", 'Although your dress should be relatively casual and applicable to the vacation setting, you should emphasize appearance over pure comfort.', 'A collared shirt and dress shoes work well for the majority of cases.', 'No matter what, stay busy during your vacation.', ""Although some people take a vacation as an opportunity to laze about, you'll only have a realistic chance of meeting new people when you're out actively doing things."", ""Check the weekly schedule for the resort you're staying at."", 'Read up on the events that are happening nearby.', ""If your resort has a bar or club, check it out and see what's going on."", 'Just about any event will provide an opportunity to meet women, so you should take up any opportunity when it presents itself.', 'Check out party events in the area.', ""Parties entail a high-energy environment that's perfect for meeting single women."", 'Meeting women during the day increases your chances as opposed to the night.', ""Because people will be relaxing throughout the day while on vacation, you'll have more time to spend with a girl than if you were saving your advances purely for the night."", 'Most guys will only approach at night, which also has the effect of increasing your competition.', 'You should be honest and authentic.', ""Even if a prospect doesn't share your postal code, she'll most likely be able to tell if you're being disingenuous towards her."", 'This includes lots of smiling.', 'Just make sure not to stare at one girl for too long.', 'This runs the risk of being interpreted as creepiness.', 'For instance, if you have a decent grasp of magic tricks using playing cards, you can approach a group of girls and ask if they would like to see a trick.', 'Some girls may even approach you for a cigarette if they see you smoking.', ""Sunscreen is also handy, as most vacationers will be in want of it if they're spending much time on the beach.""]"
"Keep the conversation light-hearted.Even if you're looking to make a serious romance with the girl you're talking with, you shouldn't touch upon any serious topics when you're first chatting with her. Invite her to do something with you.You shouldn't wait long into a conversation before asking the girl to do something fun with you. Take advantage of a vacation's excitement.Unlike a romance closer to home, there's a much greater degree of excitement when you're out on vacation. Share good experiences together.A vacation is meant to be a time where you get out and do things you're not familiar with. Look for signs of attraction.As with any interaction with a woman you're interested in, you can gauge the likelihood of your success by looking at signs of attraction. Act quickly.Vacations don't last long, so your window of opportunity will almost always be accordingly brief. Practice safety first.Vacationers who meet other singles are more likely to practice unsafe sexual practices than if they were back at home.",How to Meet a Girl on a Vacation3,"Keep the conversation light and fun.If in doubt, ask questions about her. Ask her where she's from, who's she on vacation with, and what sort of things she's seen since she got here. All of these questions can lead to positive conversations.  If you're out on vacation, there should be a wide range of activities available to you. Whether it's swimming, hiking, partying or seeing a show, you should keep the activities on-the-go and exciting.When one activity ends, start up another. This will show the girl that you are fun and spontaneous.  If you're looking to meet a woman abroad, you should take advantage of this excitement. This is especially true if the woman is out vacationing herself. While you interact with her, don't hesitate or be afraid of potentially making a fool of yourself. Because you may only know this girl for a short amount of time, there are far fewer repercussions than if you were approaching someone domestically.  You can just as easily share these things with someone you just recently met. Whether it's going to a resort club, taking a long swim or watching a tropical sunset together, the girl will associate positive feelings with you as she shares worthwhile experiences with you.  Here are some of the things you should keep an eye out for if you're trying to figure out if she's interested:If she's messaging you frequently throughout the vacation, it's a good sign that she's interested in seeing more of you.She's likely interested in pursuing things with you if she singles you out in a crowd, or spends more time with you than the party she originally came on vacation with.Typical body language signs of attraction, like twirling hair and sustained eye contact, should also be taken into account in this instance, although you should consider potential differences in culture. Women from certain cultures will manifest their attraction in more subtle ways than what you're used to dealing with.  Although you shouldn't jump in the second you meet a girl, you shouldn't wait to make your feelings and intentions known to her. If you feel you've arrived at an appropriate time, jump on the chance and see what happens.If it turns out that the girl isn't interested in you, you shouldn't take it to heart.

"Decide what you want. Look up the girl online.Looking up the girl's name on social media will give you a glimpse into her regular life. Be realistic.Romances while out on vacation can be a lot of fun, but the truth is that the vast majority of them do not last for very long. Make plans to stay in touch. Accept the potential for rejection. Reflect on the experience.Most romances while on vacation don't end up amounting to anything long-lasting.",How to Meet a Girl on a Vacation4,"After you and a certain girl have spent enough time together, there will come a point where you should figure out what it is you want from the connection. Are you content with a short-term interaction, or do you think there's the potential for something greater? If you're unsure, you might bring this subject up with the girl in question. Finding out what her thoughts are may give you some clarity.  This is helpful if you want to stay in touch, and particularly important if you think she may be leading you on. Many people will show their relationship statuses online. This way, you can see if a girl is truly as available as she says she is.Likewise, you should expect a girl to look you up online as well. This means you should avoid trying to start romance if you are already in a committed relationship with someone back home.  This is important to keep in mind going into the romance itself, as you shouldn't set yourself up for heartbreak towards the end. If anything, you should enjoy a romance for the short time it lasts. If the chemistry is really strong enough however, the two of you may want to take it further.  If the chemistry between the two of you is potent enough, you should try to keep a connection between the two of you, even if there's a major distance. Some lifelong romances have occurred in spite of originally living continents apart. Ask for her number or email information and take it from there. If the two of you manage to foster a longer-lasting correspondence, you may decide to meet up again later on down the road.  Like any romantic encounter, there is absolutely nothing to promise that the other person will feel the same way as you do. This is possibly especially true in a vacation setting, where a more prudent woman will recognize the folly of falling in love on vacation. No matter how bad it hurts at first, accept it gracefully and go back to enjoying your vacation. Don't let a rejection get in the way of the rest of your experience. It's quite possible that you'll meet another woman on the same trip and thing will turn out for the better.  Even if it doesn't pan out and you wanted it to last, the experience still leaves a lot to consider. When you return from your travels, you should take the time to reflect on what happened, and how it may have changed your opinions on your day-to-day life.","['After you and a certain girl have spent enough time together, there will come a point where you should figure out what it is you want from the connection.', ""Are you content with a short-term interaction, or do you think there's the potential for something greater?"", ""If you're unsure, you might bring this subject up with the girl in question."", 'Finding out what her thoughts are may give you some clarity.', 'This is helpful if you want to stay in touch, and particularly important if you think she may be leading you on.', 'Many people will show their relationship statuses online.', 'This way, you can see if a girl is truly as available as she says she is.', 'Likewise, you should expect a girl to look you up online as well.', 'This means you should avoid trying to start romance if you are already in a committed relationship with someone back home.', ""This is important to keep in mind going into the romance itself, as you shouldn't set yourself up for heartbreak towards the end."", 'If anything, you should enjoy a romance for the short time it lasts.', 'If the chemistry is really strong enough however, the two of you may want to take it further.', ""If the chemistry between the two of you is potent enough, you should try to keep a connection between the two of you, even if there's a major distance."", 'Some lifelong romances have occurred in spite of originally living continents apart.', 'Ask for her number or email information and take it from there.', 'If the two of you manage to foster a longer-lasting correspondence, you may decide to meet up again later on down the road.', 'Like any romantic encounter, there is absolutely nothing to promise that the other person will feel the same way as you do.', 'This is possibly especially true in a vacation setting, where a more prudent woman will recognize the folly of falling in love on vacation.', 'No matter how bad it hurts at first, accept it gracefully and go back to enjoying your vacation.', ""Don't let a rejection get in the way of the rest of your experience."", ""It's quite possible that you'll meet another woman on the same trip and thing will turn out for the better."", ""Even if it doesn't pan out and you wanted it to last, the experience still leaves a lot to consider."", 'When you return from your travels, you should take the time to reflect on what happened, and how it may have changed your opinions on your day-to-day life.']"
"Keep things light at the beginning. Show her that you have a great personality. Be a gentleman. Ask questions to get to know her better. Give her space. Impress her with your independence.

Take it slow and let things progress naturally.If you've only been together for a few weeks, or a month or two, then you should keep things light and fun. Don’t say “I love you” yet, or it may not have the effect you're hoping for.Of course, every relationship moves at its own pace. If you think you're both really approaching love after a few months, then dive in! But make sure that you're looking for love with this specific woman, not just love in general. , Demonstrate your great personality to the woman you are interested in. By being positive, kind, funny, and thoughtful, you can show her that you are a great guy who would make an excellent boyfriend.Try making her laugh by telling jokes.Remember to be kind to people.Try to maintain a positive and upbeat attitude.  You don't have to ride up on a horse to pick her up for a date, but you should make an effort to treat her like a lady. Part of being a gentleman is having stellar manners and treating people well. If you do this, then she will take notice and will be on her way to falling for you. This doesn't mean that you should not be yourself and have to start acting formal all of the time. It just means that you should try a bit harder to be polite and considerate of her needs.Here are some things any old gentleman can do:Give her your coat if she's coldUse proper table mannersPut her needs before your own when it comes to having the best seat, the last bite of food, etc.Hold open doors for herPull out her chair for herBe attentive to her needs in general, If you want a woman to fall in love with you, then you have to show her that you see her as more than just an object or a trophy to be won. Show her see that you care about who she is as a person, about what she wants, what her dreams are, and what her experiences have been. You shouldn't interrogate her, but at the same time, you have to make an effort to know who she really is besides the fun-loving, beautiful woman you see in front of you. Here are some things to ask her about:Her childhoodHer favorite memoriesHer friendshipsHer relationships with her family membersHer hopes for the futureHer job or her career goalsHer passions or hobbies, Always hanging around and calling and texting a woman will not make her fall in love with you. In order to evaluate her feelings about you, she needs some distance and space to think about you. If you're always around, asking what she's up to, or telling her how amazing she is 24/7, that won't increase her feelings of love for you. If you let her know you care but give her space at the same time, then she'll be much more likely to fall for you.Just like guys are turned off by women who come on too strong, so are women. Find a balance between letting her know how much you like her and giving her space.  If you want a woman to fall for you, then you have to make her see that you're a person who is worth falling for, not just a puppy dog she can keep on a leash. Maintain your hobbies and work hard at a job that means something to you. The happier you are on your own, the more the woman will want to be around you.For example, you could hang out with your guy friends, spend time training for a marathon, play guitar, or pursue your favorite hobby.  Another way to win a girl over is to give her compliments that actually mean something. This means you should go beyond telling her how pretty she is, and dig deeper to let her know which attributes really mean something to you.Of course, complimenting her looks will make her feel good, too, as long as it's not the only thing you're complimenting. Look for unique aspects of her personality or her life that are really worth complimenting, and she'll see that you really care. Here are some things you can say:""You always know how to crack me up, even when I'm having a bad day.""""You're so good at talking to almost anyone. My Grandma Pearl could have talked to you for hours! What a gift.""""I've never seen eyes that are the same shade of blue as yours."", If you want to deepen your bond, then you have to open up as your relationship progresses. Don’t tell her everything about yourself at first, or she may feel like there's no mystery there. But once you've been together for a while, slowly let her know about the things that matter to you. This could mean talking about your real dreams for the future, discussing a complicated friendship from the past, or even revealing your biggest fears.Try asking for her advice about things now and then to show her that you value her input.  If you want a woman to really fall in love with you, then you have to be there to support her when she needs you. This means anything from going to support her in the school play or building her up before a job interview. You'll need to be there for her when she's nervous about something, having a bad day, or just figuring out her life. Women look for this quality in a life partner, and if you want her to really fall for you, then she has to see that you'll be there for her through the good times and the bad.Try leaving an encouraging note in her lunch bag, sending her a confidence boosting text message, or just congratulate her on her accomplishments.  Trying new things now and then will help to keep things interesting and exciting in your relationship. This doesn't mean you should get a motorcycle and start doing backflips in your living room, but it does mean that you should keep an eye on the unconventional and exciting things that would take your relationship to the next level. If you do the same old thing or talk about the same old thing all the time, then the woman may begin to get a little restless.Ask your girlfriend what she has always wanted to do, but never has. Then, plan an outing so that you can try that activity. For example, maybe she has always wanted to learn how to surf. You can arrange for the two of you to take a surfing lesson together.Vary your conversation topics as well. If you're always talking about sports or the same old thing, it may get old. Read the news, read literature, watch documentaries, and just do things that make you a more interesting person -- so that you can keep her interest.  If you want a woman to really fall in love with you, then you have to work hard to make sure that her friends and family also like you.Be kind and polite to her family, be fun and sweet around her friends, and most importantly, show that you really care about her. In the end, that's the biggest thing they're looking for -- not how much money you make or how cute you are.Avoid getting in heated fights or political debates with her friends and relatives. It's just not worth it.If you really don't like one of the woman's relatives or friends, it's best to keep your mouth shut, in most cases. The woman won't like it if you're threatening one of the relationships she's had much longer than she's known you.  Surprising your girlfriend and doing thoughtful little things will show her how much you care. Though you shouldn't be her love slave, you should take the time to do little things that make her really feel loved and cared for.For example, you can send her flowers on a random day, send her a text to say you're thinking of her, cook her a meal when you know she's had a long day, or massage her feet if she's feeling tired.  If you want a woman to fall for you, then you have to make her see you as more than just a hot, exciting prospect who is perfect for right now. Let her see that you're responsible, caring, smart, fun to be around, and an all-around good long-term bet. Be your best self and show her that you're Mr. Right, not just Mr. Right Now.Being responsible is a big plus. If she sees that you can balance your checkbook, cook dinner, and do what needs to get done, she'll be very impressed.  Listening is crucial to the success of a relationship. When she needs you to listen to her, drop your distractions, look her in the eyes, and take in what she's telling you. Don't try to solve her problems or give an opinion on everything -- just be there and listen when she wants to talk.Demonstrate that you are listening by summarizing what she said and checking to see if you are understanding. For example, you could say something like, “If I’m understanding you correctly, you are feeling frustrated about your boss and the way she handles meetings. Is that right?”Ask questions to show her that you are interested in hearing more. Stick to who, what, when, where, and how questions. Avoid “why” questions because they may cause her to become defensive.  Good communication is essential for maintaining a long-lasting, loving relationship. If you find that you and your partner are not communicating very well, take the initiative and try to find out what’s been going on. Ask her how she's feeling, ask about her day, or just ask if there's anything in particular that she wants to talk about.Tell your girlfriend how you are feeling and when you want (or do not want) to talk as well. For example, if you are having a bad day and need some space, let her know.  Forgiveness is essential to a long lasting relationship. All couples argue from time to time and your girlfriend is bound to make mistakes sometimes. If you hold a grudge and refuse to forgive her for mistakes, then your relationship will suffer. Practice forgiveness when she does something that upsets you and your relationship will stand a better chance of survival.  Looks are not everything, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is good for you and good for your relationship. If you want to ensure that you feel your best and she continues to enjoy the way that you look, you have to keep taking care of yourself. Make sure that you eat well, exercise daily, and get plenty of rest and relaxation.  If you really want her to fall in love with you -- and to stay that way -- then you always have to keep making the effort. You've got to bring her flowers on random days. You should dress up for date nights. Come up with new things to do together. Never give up on trying to make her laugh.Don't quit on her if she's in a bad mood. Just keep working your charms and working hard to keep her.Don't think that, once you've both said you love each other, you've got this in the bag. You always have to keep making an effort, whether you're 20, 30, or 80.  Assess your relationship every so often to see what has changed or what needs to change. Research has shown that people undergo significant changes every 7-8 years and you will need to account for these changes in your relationship. Whether it is a new job or a new interest, it is important to address these changes in order to maintain a good relationship.  If you want your relationship to keep going strong, then you should build a list of things that you do together. You have to have a few things that are just for the two of you, which you love doing together as you build your relationship.Consider taking some Sunday morning hikes, reading together near the fireplace, making Italian meals together, going wine tasting, or running races.Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that you have to share all of the same interests -- you don't have to go to yoga just to please her, and she doesn't have to watch your favorite TV show with you if it's not her thing. Having your own interests that you maintain will help you grow stronger, too.  While you should work on doing things together, it's important to stay focused on your own goals and pursuits, too. If you're always together, one or both of you may begin to feel smothered. Keep on doing the things you love while making time for the person you love.Try setting aside a day or night where you spend time with your friends and she spends time with hers.  If you want to make a woman fall for you, and make it last forever, then you have to tell her that you love her. Do it at least once a day and say it like you really mean it. These three words can make a big impact on your life -- and your relationship.No matter how secure a woman is in her relationship, she will always like to hear that you love her.","[""Though you may

When you can make a difference, do so without hesitation, but also cautiously, as you don't want to hurt her in any way.If she likes you already, go above and beyond the call of duty. Do something that she'd never expect you to do, like cooking her breakfast and then doing the dishes, and she'll fall even harder for you. You're showing her what you're made of.If she doesn't like you yet, or you don't know how she feels about it, play it cool. Be calm. If you're the kind of guy who gets sweaty and stutters his words when he's around a girl, then just calm down. Think of her as just your friend who happens to look different. If you can't calm down, no sweat! Girls think it is adorable when guys trip over themselves. You'll make her laugh in a good way!;, Be friendly with her without always being available. Girls love guys who are a bit mysterious, so try to cultivate a bit of mystery — don't always pick up the phone, let on where you're going, etc. Be honest, but not always totally up front.  Your guy-friends probably didn't care that you walked around in the same clothes you mowed the lawn in, but the girl of your dreams probably won't be very impressed. Here are three simple things you can start doing right away that will help:Shower and shave every day. If you're not yet old enough to shave, don't sweat it. You should be soon. Smell nice and look clean by showering or bathing regularly.Wear clothes that actually fit. Not your older brother's clothes; not your dad's clothes. Wear your own clothes, and ones that flatter your figure. It doesn't matter how much money you have — every guy needs a good pair of jeans, a fitting t-shirt, a simple but elegant collared shirt, and shoes to fit the occasion.Get in shape. Lose that excess flab if you can and turn it into muscle. Most girls like guys who have developed muscles that aren't so chiseled they're intimidating. Find an intramural sports league that you're interested in and go for it. You might even be able to impress your lady with your skills.  Most men are charming in a couple different ways, but here are some charming ideas to think about:Be a gentleman. This means opening doors, paying for a date, keeping your word, etc. Girls love to feel like a gentleman cares about them.Be witty. Girls love guys who are great conversationalists, who can turn anything into a joke. Learn how to elegantly make fun of yourself.Be intelligent. You should do your best to be well-read, informed about current-affairs, and curious. Women like men who are smart but still relatable.  Every girl wants a guy who, at the end of the day, is reliable — dependable not because he has to be, but because he wants to be. Being reliable is all about telling a girl that she has security with you. Try to be the most reliable guy you know.Do what you say you're going to do. If you talk the talk, walk the walk. Girls don't like guys who say they're going to do something and never follow through with it.Be punctual. Even though some girls are late to dates, a girl hates it when she has to wait on a guy. To her, it says: ""I don't care enough about you to be on-time."" If you're going to be late, let her know.Have a good reputation. Be the guy that other guys want to vouch for. You never know whether she, or one of her friends, could ask around about you. And if she hears how you cheated on your ex-girlfriend, your reputation is shot and you'll have to rebuild it.  A person is more responsive and receptive when relaxed. This is similar to being witty, but with higher importance. It helps you connect with her emotionally/intellectually. She should enjoy your company and not be bored.  It's a turnoff when you're always around her and touching her and flirting obnoxiously with her when she is not interested and has never shown any interest at all. Learn to give her the control, even if it's only the illusion of control.If a girl doesn't want to make out, for example, or have sex, don't try to force it out of her. That's not the way to get her obsessed with you. Instead, listen to her wishes, understand why she has them, and respect them. You'll get more bees with honey than you will with vinegar.  Most women don't care how much you make, or who your parents are, so long as you can provide for them. That's nice, because most men aren't blessed with wealth. Remember these things about money around women:Women, like men, want to be spoiled some of the time. It doesn't have to be extravagant, but they like to be spoiled. Save enough money so that you can spoil her every once in a while.Most women don't like men who flaunt their money. If you have money, don't flaunt it, because you just might scare her away.  A girl might really like you but if she sees you dancing or talking with another girl, that could be a dealbreaker. Make sure she knows you're interested in only her.At the same time, have friends who are also girls. If you hang around friends who are also girls, she'll feel safer around you because other women are comfortable hanging out with you. If you never hang around any women, it could be a sign to her that you're illiterate when it comes to them.Sometimes, women engage in a little competition — just like men! Therefore, it's helpful to have other women around, provided you don't get involved or flirt with them.  Give her some good old-fashioned compliments. Don't compliment her ability to do every little thing perfectly, or you'll seem too needy or obsessive yourself. But a well-placed compliment can make a girl remember you for days on end!Be sincere when you compliment. Figure out what you like about her best — what you think makes her most unique — and tell her. If it's the truth, it will automatically come out as sincere.Reinforce how she views herself. If she thinks of herself as an athlete, reinforce her competitive spirit or athletic skills. If she thinks of herself as a thinker, praise her smarts. Whatever she thinks of herself as, compliment that aspect of her the most.Focus more on her personality than her appearance. If you have to get in a compliment about her appearance, stay away from the more feminine areas and stick to complimenting these:SmileHairEyesLipsClothes (style, appearance, etc.), Sing or hum songs, talk about movies, share favorite places. Anything that, when she hears/sees it again, will make her think of you.  Girls like guys who are in touch with their feminine side without being girly at all. That means you have to understand where she's coming from but still be thoroughly manly if you can. Learn a lesson from the following cues:It's OK to cry at a movie...if that movie is about sports. While most girls don't like sports, it's a badge of your manliness to her. Be prepared to stick with sports while still making time to see her.It's OK to dress well...but not too well. As discussed earlier, girls love a guy who can dress nicely. But as soon as the guy dresses nicer than her, that can be a big turnoff.  You should not make building a relationship with her a script. The most important thing to do when looking for a meaningful relationship is to relax around her, and let your true personality shine through. Do not force yourself to fit a stereotype. You're better off waiting until you can find a girl who likes you, not a stereotypical ""cool"" guy. A relationship in which you can be yourself is much, much more meaningful than one in which you have to pretend to be someone else.  Be yourself and be a gentlemen. Let her do what she wants and act like you care about her.","[""Whenever she is in trouble or worried about something, don't just sit there with her."", ""Acknowledge that you don't have all the

"Give her an unexpected compliment. Maintain good eye contact. Flirt!,Tease her gently. Crack an inside joke around other people. Impress her peers. If you're together, show her how important she is to you. If you're not together, make a move. Don't objectify her. Don't be creepy. Don't use inappropriate touch. Don't be cruel when you tease her. Don't rely on money or gifts.",How to Make a Girl Blush,"This is the simplest, most direct way to make a girl blush. Almost everyone appreciates a good compliment. If you choose the right words — walking the thin line between sincere and funny — she just might blush. A few tips are below.Try to make the compliment about her, rather than about her things. As a simple example, you might say ""You look great in that dress"" instead of ""I like your dress.""Explore topics besides her looks. For example, her smarts and artistic abilities are also great things to bring up.Don't lay it on too thick. One or two compliments per conversation are fine. A constant string of compliments will usually make people feel uncomfortable. , Sometimes a single look can say a thousand words. When you catch her eye as you talk, smile at her and keep your gaze for a few seconds longer than you normally would. If she is shy, even the slightest amount of eye contact may turn her cheeks pink. If she smiles back at you, this can be a sign she feels an attraction for you (though you shouldn't go off of this alone).When something else catches your attention or someone else starts talking, break your eye contact. Don't keep staring at the girl — this can come across as creepy leering.  Not all girls will blush over something as innocent as eye contact. However, a little good-natured flirting can usually do the trick. Flirting is a skill that is a little too complex to explain in a single step, so see our article on it for detailed instructions.One basic way to flirt is to give someone a ridiculous compliment with a joking or sarcastic delivery. For example, if the girl flexes to show off her bicep, you might say something like, ""Oooh, soo sexy."" It should come across like you're teasing her but being a little sincere at the same time.  This takes a little finesse, but it works great when you get good at it. Your goal here is to embarrass the girl, but only slightly and only about something that's not actually very important. You should always keep your teasing lighthearted. Back off immediately if you sense that she feels offended or deeply embarrassed.A good rule is to tease her about her skills or decisions instead of her personality or appearance. For example, teasing her about her bad driving skills can be cute. On the other hand, teasing her about a few light wisps of facial hair is a bad idea.  When you're hanging out in a group of people, try making a joke that only she will get. It can be a reference to something from your past, something funny that happened to you two but not the other people, or something that references a mutual interest. If you pull it off, she'll feel special. Out of all the people, you singled out her for some humor.Thinking up an inside joke is up to you — only you can search your shared history for something amusing to say.  Girls (like boys) listen to their peers. If she hears her friends or family talking about what an amazing, desirable person you are, she may start thinking about you in new romantic ways. Your best bet for this to happen is to simply present your best self. Look as good as you can, have confidence in yourself, and make an effort to be friendly to all of her peers.If you're already dating, impressing her parents with your politeness and achievements can be a major plus. For many girls, the approval of the parents can mean the world. A little old-fashioned chivalry and good manners in front of the parents can make you look like an absolute gentleman. If you really want to look good, consider getting a clean-cut haircut as well.  If you're dating the girl that you're trying to make blush, you have more options at your disposal because you already share a level of intimacy. Let her know that she's extremely valuable to you. If you're comfortable with the idea and your relationship has reached this point, you can also bring the ""L word"" into the conversation. For the best effect, your actions should reflect your words. A few ideas for showing your seriousness are below:Write her a sweet, hand-penned note.Make her a mix with her favorite songs on it.Take her to your favorite hiking or camping spot.Share a picnic somewhere with a gorgeous view.Treat her to a semi-fancy night out just because.  On the other hand, if the girl you're trying to make blush isn't your girlfriend, making your romantic intentions known can certainly make her blush. This can be something as simple as breaking the touch barrier (for instance, touching her shoulder as you laugh) or a little flirting. If you want to be drastic, consider asking the girl out. She's certain to be flattered, even if she doesn't feel the same way. If she does, you have an exciting new relationship to explore!If you're ready to take the plunge, see our guide on asking girls out.  When it comes to complimenting a girl, you'll want to avoid anything that makes her feel like a sex object (or a ""piece of meat"") rather than a feeling, thinking human being. Keep you compliments about her beauty, her intelligence, her decisions, and her personality. Avoid the following subjects:Her sex characteristics (e.g.  bust size)How revealing or non-revealing her clothing isHer race or ethnicityOutward identifiers of her religion or social status, While it's OK to be attracted to someone or be captivated by someone's beauty, getting too fixated on her looks can be a great way to ruin your chances. In extreme cases, this sort of behavior can constitute harassment. Actions and comments that are inappropriately personal or sexual or personal are off-limits. Avoid the following sorts of actions:Staring or ogling — especially if you're looking below the neckAsking prying questions about her dating or sex historyPressing her for a chance to hang out together if she says ""no"" or offers an excuse for why she can'tMaking any sort of comment that insinuates that she should do something sexual with you, Touching a someone inappropriately against their will is wrong. At best, it is cause for this person to get angry with you. At worst, it can be a crime. If you haven't already established that touching is OK, keep your hands to yourself except for harmless flirtatious gestures like briefly touching her shoulder as you laugh. If she appears uncomfortable or asks you to stop, stop — even if you don't think you're doing anything wrong.  As noted above, gentle teasing can be a great way to flirt with a girl and get her to blush. However, there's a fine line to be aware of here. Teasing a girl in a way that makes her feel self-conscious or under attack can lead to hurt feelings, anger, and even lasting grudges. Avoid the following sorts of topics as a general rule:Negative comments about her appearance or weightSerious criticisms of her personal, political, or religious viewsGossipy comments about her family or the people she spends time withMean-spirited imitations of her tics or habits, A few sincere presents or a fancy night out every once in a while can be great for showing that a girl means a lot to you. However, trying to throw your weight around by spending lots of money on your outings or buying luxurious gifts isn't a good idea. It may make her blush, but if she's intelligent, her blushing is likely to be out of embarrassment for you. Money is entirely separate from your ability to make girls feel special. People with lots of money can be romantic, but this isn't why they're romantic. Trying to woo girls with money is only likely to make you end up broke or in the company of women with poor life priorities.","['This is the simplest, most direct way to make a girl blush.', 'Almost

"Be friendly. However, don't stick yourself in the friend zone. Let it spread. Compliment her. Hang out with your other friends. Hang out in a group. Drop hints. Focus on you.",How to Make a Girl Chase You,"Girl like when boys make the first move. If you initiate conversation, then she'll be all the more willing to keep it up, even if she doesn't have a crush on you. , Try to be a little flirty all the time, too.Don't underestimate the power of withdrawal. If she flirts, flirt back, but keep it short and leave her wanting more. Don't make yourself so easy to get that she becomes uninterested.  Hint to someone close to her that you're interested. They're bound to tell the girl you're eyeing! Don't make it seem desperate, though. You may find out if she already likes you from a mutual friend! If she does, your work is easy! Just let her chase you.  In case you didn't know, girls like that! However, don't let her EXPECT the compliments, then it's you doing the chasing. Also, be sure to compliment the right things. If you don't know the girl well, just talking about how hot she is will make her think you're just interested in the physical stuff, and you don't want that.  Be cool! Let her see you have a social life, but don't be cocky about it, and don't try too hard to be busy or it will show.Be slightly distant without being rude. 'Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen DOESN'T work. Many girls will become confused and hurt if you try this, and may lose interest all together.  Ask her out on a group thing, but spend a lot of time with her. She'll think of it as a date subconsciously if she spends most of the night talking to you.  Describe an ideal girlfriend, using a lot of the qualities that the girl you're talking to has. Don't come right out and say it, but by dropping hints she'll begin to think of herself as a good fit for you.

Clean yourself up. Dress well. Approach with confidence. Start a conversation. Respect her personal space. Spend time with her. Don’t judge her. Become trustworthy. Show sincere interest. Avoid making her feel pressured.,How to Make a Girl Be Comfortable Around You,"First impressions make a difference. Good hygiene shows that you take care of yourself. Take a shower every morning. Wash your hair, put on deodorant, and possibly use a small amount of cologne or perfume. Bad odors, among other problems, are distracting and cause people to not want to be around you.When you use cologne or perfume, add only a small amount to your neck, chest, and shoulders. She should be able to smell it up close without it overwhelming her senses. , Clothes and hairstyle are also factors in how people judge you. If your hair is long and greasy and you wear stained sweatpants, chances are the girl will think of you in a negative way, making her feel uncomfortable. Buy yourself clothes that flatter your figure. A style that looks unique on you without being too flashy will help her appreciate you.  If you don’t feel comfortable, chances are she won’t feel comfortable either. Anytime you seek her out, display your best self. This means going up to her, maintaining eye contact, and speaking loudly and clearly. To do this, practice being natural. Look into a mirror as you speak, maintaining eye contact with yourself.Even if you feel nervous around her, slow down. Breathe deeply, speak slowly, relax, and focus on her. Be your natural self.If you’re going to be at the same place a girl is, such as school or a party, try getting to the place early. This gives you time to get accustomed to the environment before it becomes more crowded and busy.Avoid any bad habits that would make her uncomfortable, such as swearing, telling inappropriate jokes, or fidgeting.  Start with small questions, such as “That’s a nice tattoo, what does it mean?” Avoid asking deep questions, as these are too personal too soon. Instead, let her answer and then add to the conversation, such as by talking about something a little personal such as your own tattoos.  Everyone has boundaries about how physically close someone cannot be. Moving into this space too fast and being unwelcome is a sure way to make a girl feel uncomfortable. Especially early on, avoid standing too close, putting your face near hers, or touching sensitive areas such as the face. Bad touches feel uncomfortable, but welcome touches associate you with positive emotions.As you get to know her better, add positive touches such as putting a hand across her shoulder to shield her when moving through a crowd at a concert.Other positive touches include touching her elbow when making a point or brushing her back and sides when laughing together.  Once you’ve established a base, find ways to be near her. This can be as simple as a shared activity such as lunch at school, or you can do an activity that you both enjoy. By talking to her, find out her interests and spend time together building positive, memorable experiences. Try to go to different places and have different experiences, as these stand out more than spending several hours watching TV at home.An easy way to spend time together is if you belong to the same group. Spending time with shared friends, doing a school activity, or doing a hobby together are all options that take some of the pressure off of you to be entertaining.Even if you’re interested in her romantically, don’t suggest that she go on a date with you. You’re better served building up emotional comfort without revealing a motive, as this shows you value her as an individual.  There are many ways you can inadvertently end up making a judgment that makes her feel uncomfortable. Try to avoid making jokes at the expense of her interests. If she’s quiet, don’t bring up her quietness or force her to be around people all the time. Instead, it’s better for you to be patient and funny in a way that shows you accept her.Instead of saying, “Wow, comic books are for nerds” or “Why are you so quiet?” talk to her about comic books or make commentary about the cafeteria food you’re eating.This applies too to her goals in life. If she wants to be a photographer, encourage her no matter what you think of the choice.  Be the kind of person that she can confide in. This means not giving up her secrets. She may start off by telling you something in confidence. Don’t talk behind her back and don’t tell your friends. Once she knows you won’t break her trust, she’ll feel closer to you because she’ll be able to tell you more of her deeper thoughts and feelings.If you want to be more than friends with her, limit your availability. You need to be trusted, but you can’t become someone she talks to about her relationship problems or issues she doesn’t want to tell her relationship partner.Always avoid being the kind of person that’s there to provide money or food. Someone who frequently asks you to do this is using you.  Once you’ve begun building up trust between you, have deeper discussions when the timing is right. Ask her questions such as what career she wants in the future. When you do this, listen actively. Put down your phone, hear what she’s saying, and try to remember it. This shows that you care about her as a person.Remember important dates such as her birthday. Many people have a tendency to forget, so it will be impressive to her when you display consideration.  She’ll have a lot of pressures in life, including from friends and family. Don’t add to it. Never put her into a spot where she’d have to make a difficult decision, such as forcing her to leave a relationship. Give her some personal space.Don’t smother her with attention by calling or texting every day and spending all your time near her.Remember to live your life outside of your connection to her. Talk to other people. Take care of responsibilities such as school.","['First impressions make a difference.', 'Good hygiene shows that you take care of yourself.', 'Take a shower every morning.', 'Wash your hair, put on

"Put in a little time before you go in and speak to him or her. Spend some time relaxing beforehand. Think before you speak. Get to know a little bit about them. Find innovative ways to boost your self-confidence. Be outcome-independent. Approach your crush when you are alone. Introduce yourself. Ask your crush about himself or herself. Remember to interject occasionally if your crush is telling a long story. Pay attention to your body language. Don't use pick-up lines!,Don't take yourself so seriously. Ask for a date. Be aware of the situation. Handle rejection calmly.",How to Talk to Your Crush Without Being Crushed,"It pays to be prepared. You don't just take a math test without studying, or pass a driver's ed test without taking a class. The people who put time and thought into winning their crush usually have a better shot at winning them.Try to strike a good balance between preparing and being creepily prepared. Your crush likes getting the extra attention you want to give them, but they don't want to feel like you've been thinking about them every single second for the past three days. That's a bit creepy, even if it might be true!;, Take deep breaths and practice letting your entire body go limp. This is sometimes easier when you aren't in public. Try relaxing in your bed before going to sleep or when you get home or in the shower.  You can get over your nervousness — or eliminate it altogether — by taking a moment to consider your options. Practice at home before actually approaching your crush, and you won't be caught in an awkward moment of silence. Take your time, especially if you're about to make a first impression on someone who's important to you.Practice in the mirror. You'll want to make sure you know what you're going to say, but don't make it sound rehearsed. Imagine a variety of situations in which you might have the opportunity to talk to your crush, and act these out in front of the mirror. The more prepared you are, the more confident you'll be during the conversation itself.Have fun with it. Sure, try the serious versions of what you want to say, but also say it in a completely goofy way that makes you laugh. The less serious you take yourself, the more natural you will be when the time comes.  Take the time to notice what pictures they have in their notebook, or what they eat at lunch, or which sports they like to play. Knowing these small but important details will help you make conversation later on. It could help you say something like:""I noticed those movies on your notebook. I'm all about movies from the '80s. Do you have a favorite?""Hey, my friends and I were going to play some pickup after school. Maybe you'd want to join if you're up for it?"", One of the reasons you're probably afraid of being crushed is that it will hurt your confidence. Don't let that happen. It's crazy to let your confidence be swayed by just one person. Much of your confidence should come from how you feel about yourself. So find ways to boost your confidence before you really start getting to know your crush. That way, you'll be more attractive to your crush and you won't be crushed if something bad happens.Look at your Facebook wall. Studies have found that simply looking at your Facebook wall for 3 minutes can significantly boost your self-confidence.It's worth a try!Spend a little time with your dad. Studies also show that kids who spend more time with their fathers during adolescence turn out to be more confident than those who spend less.Note: It's probably best to hang out with your dad several hours before talking with your crush. It's for the best.  What does that mean? It means put yourself in a position where you don't care whether your crush likes you back. Why is this important? It's important for two reasons. It helps you deal with rejection, which is ultimately something you're going to have to do. (If you're not getting rejected somewhere along the way, you're not trying.) And secondly, it helps you have a healthier relationship with your crush. Instead of building the crush up to be a superhero who will save everything in your world, you treat them like a normal, but special, person instead.What? you say. Why would I do that? I don't even have control over it. You may not. But sometimes, we think about our crushes so much, and we imagine what life would be with them, that we start to develop unhealthy relationships with their imaginary selves. These imaginary relationships become so unhealthy that we can't imagine ourselves being without this person, all without the other person even knowing.If you're outcome-independent, your confidence grows. This is attractive to a lot of people. You don't feel that getting rejected from any one girl or any one guy is a big deal, and so you shrug it off. Your confidence is bigger than the rejection of one person.  The first time you interact on a personal level should be in a casual situation without too many other people around to distract you. The middle of the dance floor would not be great place to have a lengthy conversation, for example.Go up to your crush during lunch time in the cafeteria. Ask him or her if you can sit next to them and begin to strike up a conversation. It's often honestly as simple as that.Talk to your crush at a party. Whether it's a birthday party or a pool party, if you're both invited, you have an excuse to talk to them.Interact with him or her through one of your mutual friends. If you're friends with one of his friends, go up to the friend and start talking, waiting for him to give you something to say.  If you've already formally introduced yourself, then all you need to do is say a simple ""hi"" or ""hello."" Remember to look your crush directly into the eyes when you say hello. You're unintentionally saying a lot if you stare down at your shoes while saying hello.  Ask thought-provoking things that relate to your current situation—""why"" and ""how"" questions are typically best if you want to talk for awhile. These often lead to in-depth discussions that both of you can participate in, which is ideal when talking to a crush.Remember to try to avoid simple ""yes"" or ""no"" questions. If you ask your crush ""Did you go to school in Canada?"" they don't have to give you a long answer. If you ask your crush ""What was it like going to school in Canada?"" they'll talk a lot more.Ask them about their background. Where are they from, what do their parents do, how do they know so-and-so, etc. People, your crush included, love talking about themselves.  Meaning ask a few questions while he/she is telling the story. This will show them that you are paying attention to what they have to say. If you come up with a story to tell, make sure your crush has finished talking before you begin, and keep it short and sweet so your crush doesn't think you're full of yourself.  Your body language communicates a lot, whether or not you want it to. Sometimes, your body will says things you can't help. But a lot of the time, if you're aware of what your body is saying, you can correct it if you ever notice it betraying you. Here's what to pay attention to:Eye-contact. Making and keeping eye-contact says that you're interested in what the other person is saying.Face in their direction. Face your body in their direction. It means you're interested in what they're saying and aren't shy.Smile. Smiling says the other person makes you happy.Flirt with body language. Especially if you're a girl. Gently bat your eyelashes, twirl your hair, or touch their shoulder.Laughing at their jokes. Even if the jokes aren't that funny, smile and do your best to humor your crush.  Whatever you do, don't use pick-up lines. They're horribly cheesy and they don't really work. If you're a guy and you can't think of what to use other than a pick-up line, read this article on how to start a conversation with a girl.  Seriously. If you're like a normal person, being close to your crush is going to drive you insane. And when you feel that way, you're likely to do, well, stupid stuff. Shrug it off. If you trip over your words, say something like ""Wow. I can't speak. I guess being close to a beautiful girl will do that."" If you trip over your shoes and he comes to pick you up, asking ""Are you okay?!"" say something like ""Sure, I really thought I nailed the landing."", If you feel like the conversation is going well, don't hesitate to ask when your crush is free again. This can be anything from a couple of minutes at lunch tomorrow to a bona fide date with movie and dinner — your request will depend on how confident you feel and how your crush acts while you're talking.Once you've thought it through and you can tell they are interested in you, don't worry about asking when you can see each other after this.  You are not necessarily going to get a warm reception when you first try to initiate conversation. If your crush seems disengaged or bored, ask if anything is wrong; maybe it's been a bad day, maybe they've got something on their mind.If there doesn't appear to be anything distracting your crush and his or her annoyance with you still seems to be heightening, excuse yourself politely, make a quick escape, and consider trying another day.  It's possible that your crush just doesn't feel the same way about you. If you determine that this is the case, the two of you can still talk, but you have to accept that a romantic relationship between you is unlikely.There's nothing worse than feeling unrequited love for someone who's completely unaware of it, so if your crush friend-zones you, just accept it and move on.","['It pays to be prepared.', ""You don't just take a math test without studying, or pass a

Listen to the way she asks you if you have a crush on her. Watch for how she looks at you. Look out for her gestures and posture. Pay attention to the signs that she doesn’t like you. Hang out with her more before you decide that she does or doesn’t like you. Stop and find a good place to have a conversation. Tell her how you feel. Ask her how she feels about you. Give her an explanation of why you have feelings for her. Take some space for your immediate reaction to pass. Treat yourself like a friend. Think about her perspective and feelings. Go out with your friends. Distance yourself from her.,How to Know What to Say if Your Crush Asks You if You Like Her,"If her voice drops so that it is deeper and more breathy than usual, she may have feelings for you. People who study attraction find that girls may think that when they have feelings for someone it is more seductive to make their voice lower and huskier to attract that person. Whatever the case, paying attention to the tone of her voice could tell you whether or not she is asking you about your feelings because she has a crush on you too.  If her gaze seems to be going to your face and eyes a lot in conversation, she may like you.If she blinks a lot when you are talking to her, more than 6-10 times in a minute, then this could be another sign that she does like you. If you notice the black pupils in her eyes get smaller when she is looking at you, again, she might like you.But pay attention to the lighting when her pupils get smaller; if the lightness in the room suddenly gets brighter, that may be the reason why her pupils are getting smaller.If she raises her eyebrows often when she is talking to you, this could mean that she is worried and anxious. And the attention that she is paying to you may be because she is worried that you like her.  If while she is laughing she straightens up or positions herself so that she looks prettier, she may have a crush on you. Touching her clothes and tilting her head, too, can show that she has feelings for you, especially if they are all grouped together at the same time. For example, if she is smiling, touching her neck, and has her head tilted, that might be a very good sign.Be careful reading too much into these signs, some girls who are extroverted might act this way because they enjoy themselves in conversation. It might not mean that they have a crush on you.Notice how she gestures with her friends to see if she acts the same way in normal conversation. If she acts this way with her friends, it might only mean that she is an expressive person.  There is also body language that could mean that she is not interested in you romantically that you might want to look out for. This body language would most likely happen when you are flirting with her. If she fake smiles a lot during your interactions, for example, perhaps she is not interested in you. Fake smiling is pretty easy to spot- she will smile only with her mouth while her eyes and cheeks look normal. Another sign of possible disinterest is if she is raising her eyebrows often in conversation, this could be a sign that she is uncomfortable or nervous. Yet another sign is if she keeps her arms and legs crossed when you talk to her. This may mean that she is not interested or is closed off to you.Ask her if she is worried about anything. If she responds that something is causing her anxiety or stress, perhaps her gestures aren’t about you.If she does like you but doesn’t know if you like her too, then these signs could mean that she is anxious about her feelings for you. If you notice that she is sending you mixed signals, you may want to ask her how she feels about you.  Both guys and girls are not always very good at guessing correctly that someone is flirting with them because flirting is hard to pick up on. Attraction can be difficult to pick up on because girls, and people in general, don’t want to be obvious about their romantic feelings if they don’t know how they will be taken. So make sure you have had lots of conversations before you decide whether she likes you or not. Most of all, it is important that you pay attention to the way that she acts toward you over time.  If she asks you if you have a crush on her and you are in a place where it is difficult to talk, relocate to a better place. Tell her “I want to talk to you about this. Can we find a better place to talk?”. Go to a place where you two can sit down and talk. This could be a park bench, a coffee table, or a corner in a house that is quiet.Ask her how she feels about going to a particular place if you are worried that she may not be comfortable leaving where you are at the moment.  Once you are situated you should bring back up the topic of conversation. Say “So you asked me about how I feel about you” this will bring a good level of anticipation to your answer. You can add a pause if you want to. Then say “I have a crush on you.” Don’t be overly confident when you tell her how you feel, this could make you seem arrogant or hurt you if she doesn’t like you back. Go for a slightly hopeful and matter of fact tone.It is good to own your feelings whether or not you think that she likes you back. Even if you experience rejection, you will be able to move on faster because you were honest.You might be tempted to ask her why she is asking before you answer, but she will appreciate it if you are bold enough and answer her question without asking for an explanation. Also, this confidence will most likely make you more attractive.  You have a right to know if she likes you back. You can ask the question straight out- “Do you have romantic feelings for me?”. It is good to be specific with this question, even if it seems unnecessary to be specific or sounds weird. The reason why it can be better to say “romantic feelings” is because people can take “like” in lots of different ways. For example, it may be harder for her to answer you honestly if you use “like me” instead of “like me romantically”.Remember that it is better for you in the long run to hear her honest answer about her feelings, rather than an ambiguous response. The sooner you know her honest feelings about you the sooner you can move on if she doesn’t like you.Don’t assume her reasons for asking you, so be kind and honest with her, even if you think that she doesn’t like you.Depending on her personality and her feelings, there are a variety of ways she could respond. Here are a few possibilities: she could answer with a straight yes or no, or she might not want to hurt your feelings so she may say things like “I really like you as a friend”. Finally, she might answer ambiguously because she doesn’t want to hurt you and/or doesn’t know how she feels about you. She might say “I kind of like you but I don’t know.”, This explanation will vary a lot based on how she feels. No matter how she feels, it is nice to say something in response to her answer. Even if she doesn’t like you, you should be kind to her and respect her feelings.If she likes you back or seems to like you back, you can tell her all the awesome reasons why you like her. You can talk about how pretty you think she is, how intelligent you find her, how funny you think she is, how caring and kind you think that she is, etc.. Be sure to use specific and concrete examples to compliment her. For example, you can talk about when you first knew you liked her and how you knew. Describe how you knew with a short story, “I knew I had a crush on you when we were sitting next to each other in Algebra. At first you were so annoying because you knew all the answers to the questions but after a while I found that I couldn’t stop smiling when I saw your hand raised.”If she seems confused or ambiguous, you can ask her if she wants you to explain your romantic feelings for her. If she wants to know then you can explain all the awesome ways you feel about her. Be careful while you explain if she doesn’t know how she feels about you because telling her how you feel might make you feel more vulnerable. If she doesn’t want you to go on, respond with the next response.If she doesn’t like you back, keep your cool and try to genuinely thank her for being honest with you. Tell her something nice and short. For example, “I think you are a really cool person. Thanks for being honest with me.” She will respect you for being a big person and taking the rejection well. If you are having a hard time with your emotions, you can say “I think I need some space and time. Thanks for talking to me.” Then you can find somewhere to go to be alone for a while.  You may feel intense feelings if you are rejected, but try to let your first panicked emotions wash over you. Your feelings will get less intense after a couple of days. Try to wait for them patiently to pass, and avoid talking about it to people who you might regret talking to later or doing anything that you will regret. For example, do not post on social media about her.Exercise can help you process your emotions. Going on a run or doing your exercise routine if you notice that your emotions are getting out of control is a healthy way to handle your emotions. , We all talk to ourselves in our heads and sometimes we can be very hard on ourselves after we have been rejected. For example, you might say to yourself “No one will ever like me.” But when you start to think these negative thoughts ask yourself if your friend would talk to you like that. A friend would never say “No one will ever like you”, and not only because it is not very nice, but because it is an unfair and overly negative conclusion that a friend would not think. Focus on redirecting your negative thoughts to all of the good things that you did, the ways you can still grow, or the humor in the situation.Reframe your negative thoughts into positive ones. Instead of “No one will ever like you”, think “She doesn’t like me but that doesn’t mean I don’t have great qualities.” Or focus on the good things you did. Say to yourself something like, “It was an awkward situation, but you were honest and nice.”, Ask yourself what other things are going on in her life. This might be something difficult to do at first, but the more you can understand what is going on with her the less the rejection will probably seem about you. Remember her feelings are part of a bigger picture that doesn’t involve you.Be careful about making assumptions about the way she feels about you. For example, you might think “She doesn’t like me because I have a funny voice.” But you can’t read her thoughts. She may have recently gotten out of a relationship or is interested in someone else, whatever the case, she is probably preoccupied thinking about her own life and feelings.  Spend time with good friends who make you feel good about yourself. These people will remind you of your interests and the things that you love. Pick activities where you will laugh and have fun. For example, go out to a funny movie with your friends and then talk about it after. Laughter will release your endorphins and help you relax.  If you are having a hard time with your emotions, tell her that you’d like some time and space from your friendship. Having her out of your life for the time being will help you focus on you. Start hanging out with a different friend group or talking to new people- this will help you distance yourself from her. When you feel like you are ready to move on, start talking to girls you are interested in.","['If her voice drops so that it is deeper and more breathy than usual, she may have feelings for you.',

Talk to your friends about your crush. Don't hang out alone with your crush at first. Always remember that your crush is a human being. Keep your self-esteem high. Don't pester your crush with constant attention. Don't be afraid to make the occasional mistakes. Don't let yourself get overcome with anxiety. Don't be too shy to ever express your true feelings.,How to Talk to Your Crush when You're Nervous,"Remember: nothing is easier if you don't talk about it. Your close friends should be your trusted advisers when it comes to dealing with crushes. Even if you don't take their advice, it'll feel great to get this major source of emotional stress off of your chest, so speak up!Another side benefit is that talking to your friends about your crush can force you to actually do something about it. Once your friends know about it, they'll subtly push you to take action. This can be a good thing if you'd lack confidence normally. , To deal with a crush, you must crawl before you can walk. Try to limit your one-on-one time with your crush initially. Instead, try to hang out in groups. It's much easier to come across as charming when you have your friends around to do some of the ""work"" in the conversation for you. Being in the company of people you already know will also make you feel more at ease, so conversation will come more naturally.Gradually move on to one-on-one hangout sessions. Eventually, if you want your crush to develop into something more, you'll need to spend some alone time with that person.  Try not to think of your crush as ""perfect"" or unattainable — s/he is not. Your crush has flaws, fears, and things s/he is bad at. In other words, your crush is a human being just like you. Letting yourself believe that your crush is somehow ""better"" than other people will only make it harder to keep your cool when you're together.If you find yourself freaking out when you're around your crush, think back to some time that you remember her/him doing something wrong. This can be almost anything, like getting a fact wrong, making a bad play during a sports game, or accidentally doing something embarrassing. This is a good way to remind yourself that your crush is far from perfect, even if it may not always seem like it.  Staying calm about your crush isn't all about how you manage your thoughts and behavior. It's also about how you think about yourself. Remember that you are the most important one in your interactions with your crush. If you think to yourself, ""My crush would be lucky to have me"" and not the other way around, it will be much easier to talk to this person.This can also protect you if your crush turns out not to be such a great person. If you're devoted to your crush from the start, it may be easy for him or her to take advantage of your kindness. On the other hand, if you value yourself, you'll have no reason at all to take any disrespect.  Once you can talk to your crush, this doesn't necessarily mean that you always should. Remember, your crush is like you — s/he most likely has responsibilities that take up a good portion of the day. Texting, talking, or calling this person 24/7 will make you an annoyance in your crush's eyes.A good general rule is to always try to end the conversation a little earlier than you think you need to. Not only will this prevent awkward, drawn-out exchanges, but also leave your crush wanting to talk to you again.  Everyone makes mistakes — even you and your crush. Don't worry if you use the wrong word around your crush or have an embarrassing Freudian slip. These are things that happen naturally from time to time during normal conversations. Simply laugh at your mistake and move on. If you think your mistake has offended your partner, apologize, then change the subject. Stressing out will only call extra attention to any awkwardness.  Whether or not it goes well, a conversation with a crush isn't the most important thing in the world. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to calm yourself in the event that you feel your nervousness become overwhelming. Try these easy steps to get yourself under control as soon as you feel extremely anxious:Remove yourself from the difficult situation. You can tell a white lie here. Something like, ""Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom"" usually works.Let your emotions out. If you're sad, cry somewhere private. If you're angry, try punching a pillow.Take deep breaths. This will slow your heart rate and help you get your emotions under control.When you're ready, go back to what you were doing with your head held high.  Having a crush is great, but keeping it a secret isn't. If you really feel strongly about someone, consider telling this person how you feel. Opening up about your feelings may lead to a relationship, but even if it doesn't, it's often satisfying to get your emotions off your chest.

"Have confidence, even if you are shy. Be yourself when you speak with your crush. Start simply. Have an interesting topic to talk about. Don't lie or embellish when you talk to your crush. Be nice. Break bad habits. Make things clear. Ask him/her out if your crush likes you back.",How to Talk to Your Crush Even Though You Are Shy,"Or, fake it till you make it––just thinking about being more confident can help even if you don't actually feel this way. Think of who you are, and if your crush likes you the way you are, they will accept you. Having confidence is one of the key ways to get your crush's attention. Not having enough confidence will show through your words and actions. Be proud of who you are!Stand up straight. Good posture will trick your brain into thinking you're confident. , Your crush may not like you if you pretend to be someone you're not. Plus, it gets tiring to have to put on an act every day. Your personality should shine through your words. Never be ashamed of who you are - don't try to hide yourself!, Conversations can be easily started with just a simple sentence. All it takes is bravery and confidence in yourself. If you are passing in the hallways, just try to get the courage to greet them and softly smile. There is nothing more powerful than a genuine, acknowledging smile. Eye contact is also very important in this step.If you have a crush on a girl, compliment her on things she does in class as well, or something you know she did like an event or win an award. It will mean a lot more to her if you complement her actions rather than her outfit or hair. You should show an interest in their personality, not just their looks.If you have a crush on a guy, you might want to compliment their looks and outfits (if you really like an item of clothing they wear well, like a hat, compliment it), or focus on something they did. For example, you could say, ""Hey, that presentation you did in class was great"" or ""You did great at yesterday's soccer game!"". Things like this will boost their ego and make them feel great about themselves.  Read some blogs or check the news. Read magazines, books, watch TV, have adventures, listen to different music, and watch different movies. If you expand your knowledge to a variety of topics, you'll have lots to talk about with your crush!, If they enjoy a hobby that you don't, refrain from lying and telling them you like it also. Your crush will eventually discover the truth and their opinion of you will diminish.  Never give your crush mean looks or anything to draw attention unless they know you're joking with them. When you do tease or joke with them, make sure it's obvious and that you don't really mean it. However, too much teasing may lead to hurt feelings and a sour relationship! Keep your teasing to a minimum and light-hearted; tease them only about things you know that they won't mind. Keep away from touchy topics.  If you have any bad habits while talking to your crush, you'll be at a downside. Try to be yourself, but refrain from cursing excessively, calling everything retarded, etc. Keep your conversations innocent, clean, but entertaining in a positive way.  After talking to crush a lot, finally come out with saying you like them, but don't say the exact line! Your line should be something like a hint, but big and clear enough that your crush will get the point and understand. Come up with something original:""Hey uh...I've been talking a lot with you because I like you""""Hi, nice to see you again, um, look, I like you""""Hey. I gotta tell you something. I maybe um, sorta kinda like you a little bit""""Uh hi.. um okay I know I'm shy and all, but I have feelings for you.."" something like that might work.""Hey um, look, I have to tell you something, and you might like it, or might not. -sigh- I like you.""""Hi, um, look, I think you're a cool person. I'm sure there's someone that likes you out there."" will be good enough (see tips for more suggestions).Refrain from sounding like you have practiced the line. One to three ""um"" or ""ah"" will make it sound more natural - stick them in appropriate places!Try not to use ""um"" and ""ah"" too much. It will make your crush think that you're far too shy! When confessing your crush on them, let them know about it with confidence. Everyone likes someone with confidence - the more confidence, the better. However, be careful about having too much confidence!Have eye contact when you're telling your crush you like him/her. It will make you appear more confident and it makes you look bold!, However, if your crush doesn't feel the same about you, it's fine. There are plenty of other fish in the sea.

"Find out your crush's email. Don't sound like you're saying something smart (like a know-it-all). If your crush keeps emailing, score!,If you are smarter than your crush, make no comments that are sarcastic, confusing or unanswerable.

Never get too clingy, always expecting an email. If you tell them you like them via email make sure they like you back.

Say hello and wave when you see them. Prepare questions ahead of time if you get tongue-tied. Ask your crush how they’re doing to keep it simple. Comment on the weather for a low-pressure topic. Introduce yourself casually if you’ve never officially met your crush. Talk about classes or interests you have in common. Avoid stressing out if you had an awkward conversation. Stay positive during casual conversations. Offer a thoughtful compliment to make them smile.,How to Talk to Your Crush Casually1,"Raise your hand, smile, and say hi when you see them. This simple exchange can allow your crush to start really noticing you. It’s also a great way to open conversations, and your crush may respond to your greeting by asking you a question.  You might find that you’re too nervous to say anything every time you try to talk to your crush. To avoid this, come up with a list of simple questions that can allow the two of you to begin chatting when you bump into each other. Once you break the ice with the first question, it’ll be much easier to keep the conversation going.  “How are you?” is the most natural question in the world. It’s an expected next step after someone says hello, so your crush won’t be weirded out when you ask them this question. It’s also not a question that you can answer with just a quick yes or no, so it’s perfect for opening up a more in-depth interaction.Try saying something like: “Hey Tom, what’s up? Did you have a good weekend?”, Talking about the weather is easy, because everyone experiences it. It’s also not something that people usually disagree on. Most people enjoy sunshine and don’t love it when there are too many cloudy or rainy days in a row. These discussions can help you get comfortable talking to your crush without venturing into emotional or personal territory.Ask: “Do you happen to know if it’s stopped raining? I forgot my umbrella today.” Or, “Have you been outside yet today? It’s beautiful!”, Having a crush on someone who doesn’t know your name is especially scary and maybe even depressing. But just because they don’t know you now doesn’t mean it has to stay that way! If you walk past them in the hallway a few times a day and make eye contact, they’ve already noticed you. Add an introduction the next time you see them.Say: “I see you around all the time, but I’ve never actually gotten your name. I’m Sarah.”, You and your crush may be in a class together, or you may work at the same restaurant. You may even share a passion for Star Wars. These are perfect topics to discuss with your crush, as they’ll highlight your similarities and shared experiences. There’s nothing better than having an inside joke with your crush about your slightly odd manager.  You may find yourself over-analyzing every interaction you have with your crush. Maybe you’re feeling embarrassed because you stammered through a greeting, or revealed a strange, personal detail about yourself by accident. Take a deep breath. You probably remember the conversation much better than they do.Tell yourself that you’ve got another chance to show them who you are tomorrow. There’s no point in dwelling on what happened yesterday or this morning.  It’s easy to gossip or complain about something or someone, so this may be what comes out of your mouth when you’re nervous. But try as hard as you can to keep your complaints to a minimum in interactions with your crush. Instead, focus on what you like about the world around you. This will allow you both to enjoy your chats with one another.For example, don’t say: “I really hate Mr. Smith’s class. He’s such a pain.” Instead, go with: “Mr. Smith is tough, but his classes are interesting. What do you think about his latest assignment?”, Everyone enjoys receiving nice and genuine compliments about themselves. Try to avoid complimenting only your crush’s appearance. Instead, share comments that make your crush aware that you appreciate their personality, talents, and strengths.For example, if you saw them give a presentation that day, tell them how much you enjoyed it. You could also take the opportunity to compliment them on one of the aspects of their personality that you like about them. Say, “you know, you’re a really good listener.” Or, “It’s awesome that you take the time to help other people with their problems.”","['Raise your hand, smile, and say hi when you see them.', 'This simple exchange can allow your crush to start really noticing you.', 'It’s also a great way to open conversations, and your crush may respond to your greeting by asking you a question.', 'You might find that you’re too nervous to say anything every time you try to talk to your crush.', 'To avoid this, come up with a list of simple questions that can allow the two of you to begin chatting when you bump into each other.', 'Once you break the ice with the first question, it’ll be much easier to keep the conversation going.', '“How are you?” is the most natural question in the world.', 'It’s an expected next step after someone says hello, so your crush won’t be weirded out when you ask them this question.', 'It’s also not a question that you can answer with just a quick yes or no, so it’s perfect for opening up a more in-depth interaction.', 'Try saying something like: “Hey Tom, what’s up?', 'Did you have a good weekend?”, Talking about the weather is easy, because everyone experiences it.', 'It’s also not something that people usually disagree on.', 'Most people enjoy sunshine and don’t love it when there are too many cloudy or rainy days in a row.', 'These discussions can help you get comfortable talking to your crush without venturing into emotional or personal territory.', 'Ask: “Do you happen to know if it’s stopped raining?', 'I forgot my umbrella today.”', 'Or, “Have you been outside yet today?', 'It’s beautiful!”, Having a crush on someone who doesn’t know your name is especially scary and maybe even depressing.', 'But just because they don’t know you now doesn’t mean it has to stay that way!', 'If you walk past them in the hallway a few times a day and make eye contact, they’ve already noticed you.', 'Add an introduction the next time you see them.', 'Say: “I see you around all the time, but I’ve never actually gotten your name.', 'I’m Sarah.”', ', You and your crush may be in a class together, or you may work at the same restaurant.', 'You may even share a passion for Star Wars.', 'These are perfect topics to discuss with your crush, as they’ll highlight your similarities and shared experiences.', 'There’s nothing better than having an inside joke with your crush about your slightly odd manager.', 'You may find yourself over-analyzing every interaction you have with your crush.', 'Maybe you’re feeling embarrassed because you stammered through a greeting, or revealed a strange, personal detail about yourself by accident.', 'Take a deep breath.', 'You probably remember the conversation much better than they do.', 'Tell yourself that you’ve got another chance to show them who you are tomorrow.', 'There’s no point in dwelling on what happened yesterday or this morning.', 'It’s easy to gossip or complain about something or someone, so this may be what comes out of your mouth when you’re nervous.', 'But try as hard as you can to keep your complaints to a minimum in interactions with your crush.', 'Instead, focus on what you like about the world around you.', 'This will allow you both to enjoy your chats with one another.', 'For example, don’t say: “I really hate Mr. Smith’s class.', 'He’s such a pain.”', 'Instead, go with: “Mr. Smith is tough, but his classes are interesting.', 'What do you think about his latest assignment?”, Everyone enjoys receiving nice and genuine compliments about themselves.', 'Try to avoid complimenting only your crush’s appearance.', 'Instead, share comments that make your crush aware that you appreciate their personality, talents, and strengths.', 'For example, if you saw them give a presentation that day, tell them how much you enjoyed it.', 'You could also take the opportunity to compliment them on one of the aspects of their personality that you like about them.', 'Say, “you know, you’re a really good listener.”', 'Or, “It’s awesome that you take the time to help other people with their problems.”']"
Listen attentively by tilting your head or nodding. Maintain eye contact while you talk to your crush. Smile when you chat with with your crush.,How to Talk to Your Crush Casually2,"When you like someone, it’s important to show interest in the things that are important to that person. When your crush tells you a story or gives their opinion, use your facial expressions to demonstrate that you’re paying attention. Listening will also allow you to bring up the topic in later conversations.  Be sure to stay focused on your crush’s eyes and face whenever the two of you chat. This will let them know you’re engaged in your interactions with them. This could also act as a subtle way to show them that you like them.Avoid making your eye contact creepy. Allow yourself to blink, and don’t be so worried about maintaining eye contact that you never look away from your crush’s face.  When you pass them in the hallway or have a casual conversation by your lockers, smile. This will light up your face and show that you’re a positive and confident person. This could also make them enjoy your interactions more and cause them to look forward to seeing you each day.","['When you like someone, it’s important to show interest in the things that are important to that person.', 'When your crush tells you a story or gives their opinion, use your facial expressions to demonstrate that you’re paying attention.', 'Listening will also allow you to bring up the topic in later conversations.', 'Be sure to stay focused on your crush’s eyes and face whenever the two of you chat.', 'This will let them know you’re engaged in your interactions with them.', 'This could also act as a subtle way to show them that you like them.', 'Avoid making your eye contact creepy.', 'Allow yourself to blink, and don’t be so worried about maintaining eye contact that you never look away from your crush’s face.', 'When you pass them in the hallway or have a casual conversation by your lockers, smile.', 'This will light up your face and show that you’re a positive and confident person.', 'This could also make them enjoy your interactions more and cause them to look forward to seeing you each day.']"
Comment on your crush’s photos and posts. Use Instagram or Snapchat for one- or two-line direct messages. Use Facebook or Twitter for longer DMs about mutual interests. Avoid over-liking or commenting on posts to keep it casual. Post fun things that reflect your personality. Ask a mutual friend to tag you to amplify your online presence.,How to Talk to Your Crush Casually3,"Follow your crush on the social media platform they use most often. When your crush posts something new, take the time to check it out. Let them know you’re staying updated on their activities by liking and commenting on posts you especially appreciate. They may reach out and do the same for you.Try commenting on a picture of a concert or event they attended by saying, “I love the Chainsmokers! So cool you got to see them live!” This will let your crush know you share their interests.If your crush posts a more routine photo that you like for its artsiness, say, “Artsy! I like this shot.”, Sometimes, it’s easier to talk to your crush online than in person, so private messages may provide a good way to learn more about your crush. These two popular platforms are designed for sharing photos more than words. Because you need to limit yourself to a few sentences, keep it simple and just remind them you’re thinking of them.If your crush posts a picture from their vacation on Instagram, you could say, “Have fun in Paris! Can’t wait to hear about it when you get back!” If you’re feeling daring, try ending with, “I’ll miss you!” You can even add an emoji.  Following someone on Twitter and even Facebook will likely inform you of their likes, dislikes, and interests. If you share a particular view or activity with your crush, use a private message to start a conversation about it. This could allow the two of you to have an in-depth conversation about a common passion.Maybe your crush just posted about a lesser-known politician you also happen to like. Try saying: “Wow! I can’t believe you know who Pete Buttigieg is. We should totally talk about him over coffee.”Your crush may have just posted that they had a guitar class at the same music school where you go for piano lessons. Message them by saying, “This is crazy, but we both take lessons on Wednesday afternoons! We should carpool. And start a band.”, Don’t like or comment on all of your crush’s posts, and stick to only recent posts. Otherwise, your crush may get a creepy vibe from you. You don’t want your crush to feel like you don’t have your own interests and life outside of reviewing their feeds.  Just as you’re likely tempted to obsess over your crush’s posts, you may be worrying about what you should post to make your crush like you. Instead of trying to get in your crush’s head and imagining what they might want to see, post things that make you happy, laugh, or smile. This will allow your crush to use your feed to get to know you better.  If your crush is closer with one of your friends than with you, ask that friend to use their posts to make your crush notice you. They can tag you in photos, or post when you’re going out together. If your crush sees these posts, they may ask your mutual friend about you.","['Follow your crush on the social media platform they use most often.', 'When your crush posts something new, take the time to check it out.', 'Let them know you’re staying updated on their activities by liking and commenting on posts you especially appreciate.', 'They may reach out and do the same for you.', 'Try commenting on a picture of a concert or event they attended by saying, “I love the Chainsmokers!', 'So cool you got to see them live!”', 'This will let your crush know you share their interests.', 'If your crush posts a more routine photo that you like for its artsiness, say, “Artsy!', 'I like this shot.”', ', Sometimes, it’s easier to talk to your crush online than in person, so private messages may provide a good way to learn more about your crush.', 'These two popular platforms are designed for sharing photos more than words.', 'Because you need to limit yourself to a few sentences, keep it simple and just remind them you’re thinking of them.', 'If your crush posts a picture from their vacation on Instagram, you could say, “Have fun in Paris!', 'Can’t wait to hear about it when you get back!”', 'If you’re feeling daring, try ending with, “I’ll miss you!”', 'You can even add an emoji.', 'Following someone on Twitter and even Facebook will likely inform you of their likes, dislikes, and interests.', 'If you share a particular view or activity with your crush, use a private message to start a conversation about it.', 'This could allow the two of you to have an in-depth conversation about a common passion.', 'Maybe your crush just posted about a lesser-known politician you also happen to like.', 'Try saying: “Wow!', 'I can’t believe you know who Pete Buttigieg is.', 'We should totally talk about him over coffee.', '”Your crush may have just posted that they had a guitar class at the same music school where you go for piano lessons.', 'Message them by saying, “This is crazy, but we both take lessons on Wednesday afternoons!', 'We should carpool.', 'And start a band.”, Don’t like or comment on all of your crush’s posts, and stick to only recent posts.', 'Otherwise, your crush may get a creepy vibe from you.', 'You don’t want your crush to feel like you don’t have your own interests and life outside of reviewing their feeds.', 'Just as you’re likely tempted to obsess over your crush’s posts, you may be worrying about what you should post to make your crush like you.', 'Instead of trying to get in your crush’s head and imagining what they might want to see, post things that make you happy, laugh, or smile.', 'This will allow your crush to use your feed to get to know you better.', 'If your crush is closer with one of your friends than with you, ask that friend to use their posts to make your crush notice you.', 'They can tag you in photos, or post when you’re going out together.', 'If your crush sees these posts, they may ask your mutual friend about you.']"
Ask your crush for their phone number if you don’t already have it. Text your crush to keep talking even when you’re apart. Invite your crush to a group gathering. Invite them to go with you to an event you know they’d enjoy. Tell them you like them. Respect their choice if they tell you they don’t like you.,How to Talk to Your Crush Casually4,"Once you’ve spent some time getting to know your crush either in person or online, see if they’re willing to share their phone number. This will allow you to reach out and chat via text.Ask your crush for their number by using a shared class or project as an excuse. Say: “Hey, I could really use your help on the Pre-Calc assignment. Could we exchange numbers?” Once you have each other’s numbers, you can start texting each other just to say hello.Be bold and tell them you want their number to talk more. Try: “You know, we’ve been chatting a lot lately. Want to give me your number so we can text, too?”, Texting can act as a good way to slowly increase the amount of time the two of you interact. Avoid sending your crush multiple texts before you receive one back, and use emojis sparingly. You can start by reaching out with simple questions, which may then lead to longer, more detailed communications.Try starting a conversation by mentioning seeing them earlier during the day, and then asking them how they’ve been since you saw them. For example, “Hey! It was fun hanging out at lunch today. How was your afternoon?”, See if your crush will join you in a group setting. Ask them to come to a study session, go out for drinks with friends, or attend a game with several of your acquaintances. Once you’re at the event, interact with your crush and use the time to flirt a little.  Now that you know your crush a bit better, you’re likely aware of the interests the two of you have in common. These don’t necessarily need to be dates, and you can avoid defining them if you’d like. Instead, take the opportunity to increase your one-on-one time with your crush on activities that show how many interests you share!For example, there might be a movie coming out you know your crush is excited about because you talked about last week. Or you might have just found out that you and your crush are both avid rock-climbers. Take advantage of these commonalities!This question could look like: “So, I know you’re really excited about the new Wonder Woman movie. I really want to see it too, but my other friends aren’t into superheroes. Would you want to go together?”If they ask you if it’s a date, respond depending on whether you’re ready to “officially” ask them out. You could either say, “I don’t really know. How would feel about it being a date?” Or, “No, we’d just go as friends.” Your other option would be to go for it and say, “Yeah, it’s a date.”, At some point, it will be time to take the plunge and be honest about your feelings. This conversation could be exactly what’s needed for you and your crush to become something more. They may even be too shy to tell you that they have a crush on you!If you’ve already asked your crush to hang out with you one-on-one, this confession might be less of a surprise to them.You can either confess directly, saying simply, “I really like you as more than a friend. Do you like me in that way too?” Or, you can be more subtle: “We’ve been spending tons of time together, and I feel like we enjoy the same things. We might have a lot of fun if we spent even more time together as something more than friends. What do you think?”Be prepared for disappointment, because it’s impossible to predict or control someone else’s feelings. Even though you’ve interpreted your interactions as flirtation, your crush may have thought you were just becoming good friends.  You don’t need to stop liking your crush, and, in fact, you likely can’t force yourself to do so. However, if they tell you to back off, you need to understand that they have the right to make that choice. This doesn’t mean the two of you can’t still be friends. Besides, if you stay friends, their feelings for you may change.","['Once you’ve spent some time getting to know your crush either in person or online, see if they’re willing to share their phone number.', 'This will allow you to reach out and chat via text.', 'Ask your crush for their number by using a shared class or project as an excuse.', 'Say: “Hey, I could really use your help on the Pre-Calc assignment.', 'Could we exchange numbers?”', 'Once you have each other’s numbers, you can start texting each other just to say hello.', 'Be bold and tell them you want their number to talk more.', 'Try: “You know, we’ve been chatting a lot lately.', 'Want to give me your number so we can text, too?”, Texting can act as a good way to slowly increase the amount of time the two of you interact.', 'Avoid sending your crush multiple texts before you receive one back, and use emojis sparingly.', 'You can start by reaching out with simple questions, which may then lead to longer, more detailed communications.', 'Try starting a conversation by mentioning seeing them earlier during the day, and then asking them how they’ve been since you saw them.', 'For example, “Hey!', 'It was fun hanging out at lunch today.', 'How was your afternoon?”, See if your crush will join you in a group setting.', 'Ask them to come to a study session, go out for drinks with friends, or attend a game with several of your acquaintances.', 'Once you’re at the event, interact with your crush and use the time to flirt a little.', 'Now that you know your crush a bit better, you’re likely aware of the interests the two of you have in common.', 'These don’t necessarily need to be dates, and you can avoid defining them if you’d like.', 'Instead, take the opportunity to increase your one-on-one time with your crush on activities that show how many interests you', 'share!For example, there might be a movie coming out', 'you know your crush is excited about because you talked about last week.', 'Or you might have just found out that you and your crush are both avid rock-climbers.', 'Take advantage of these commonalities!This question could look like: “So, I know you’re really excited about the new Wonder Woman movie.', 'I really want to see it too, but my other friends aren’t into superheroes.', 'Would you want to go together?”If they ask you if it’s a date, respond depending on whether you’re ready to “officially” ask them out.', 'You could either say, “I don’t really know.', 'How would feel about it being a date?”', 'Or, “No, we’d just go as friends.”', 'Your other option would be to go for it and say, “Yeah, it’s a date.”', ', At some point, it will be time to take the plunge and be honest about your feelings.', 'This conversation could be exactly what’s needed for you and your crush to become something more.', 'They may even be too shy to tell you that they have a crush on you!If you’ve already asked your crush to hang out with you one-on-one, this confession might be less of a surprise to them.', 'You can either confess directly, saying simply, “I really like you as more than a friend.', 'Do you like me in that way too?”', 'Or, you can be more subtle: “We’ve been spending tons of time together, and I feel like we enjoy the same things.', 'We might have a lot of fun if we spent even more time together as something more than friends.', 'What do you think?”Be prepared for disappointment, because it’s impossible to predict or control someone else’s feelings.', 'Even though you’ve interpreted your interactions as flirtation, your crush may have thought you were just becoming good friends.', 'You don’t need to stop liking your crush, and, in fact, you likely can’t force yourself to do so.', 'However, if they tell you to back off, you need to understand that they have the right to make that choice.', 'This doesn’t mean the two of you can’t still be friends.', 'Besides, if you stay friends, their feelings for you may change.']"

Your crush may not be interested in talking to you or they may be heading somewhere in a hurry. , After saying “Hello,” strike up a conversation by asking your crush a question. You may choose to pose a generic stock question, ask them a school related question, or tailor the question to your crush’s interests and activities.Stock questions include: “How are you doing?” “What are you doing over break?” “Were you at the game last night?” “Do you work at _____?”School related questions include: “Did we have homework in English class?” “Do you want to study for the test together?” “What did you think about the quiz?” “Do you need help with the Math homework?”Personalized questions include: “How did you play in the game last night?” “Have you ever seen (insert band’s name) perform live?” ” “What are you doing this weekend?” “Are you going to the party?” “How was your vacation?”, After asking the question, remain focused on your crush.

"Learn to love yourself. Start accepting compliments. Develop a list of conversation starters. Don’t wait for your crush to make the first move. Stay calm, cool, and collected throughout the conversation.",How to Talk to Your Crush Easily Without Hesitation3,"The key to flirting and conversing with your crush is confidence. Your crush can’t see how incredible you are unless you truly believe that you are awesome. You don’t need to strive to be perfect, the most beautiful, the coolest, the smartest, or the funniest person in room—just be the best version of yourself.Instead of criticizing your appearance, identify your best attributes. Write them down and repeat these positive qualities to yourself whenever you feel insecure. When you look in the mirror, you will start to notice your favorite features instead of focusing on your least favorite features.Make a second list of your best characteristics. Are you a great friend, a hard worker, an awesome teacher, or a talented musician? Do you show compassion and kindness to everyone, are you willing to give others second chances, or do you have the ability to make unbiased decisions? Your best characteristics are some of your most attractive qualities.  It is difficult to accept compliments when you lack confidence. You may struggle to accept that someone thinks you’re attractive or talented. Instead of thanking them, you might say, “I’m really not ____” or “Thanks, but I’m not that_____.” Give your self-confidence a boost by accepting these positive comments.When you start receiving compliments from others, you will start believing that their comments are true.Instead of saying “Thanks, but ____,” simply say “Thanks” and smile. As you grow more comfortable and confident, you can expand your reply.  It is way easier to make the excuse, “I have nothing to say,” than it is to actually talk to a crush. This excuse, however, is not valid. You don’t need to have an arsenal full of bizarre facts, funny anecdotes, insightful comments, and probing questions to talk to someone. Instead, you just need to be genuinely interested in what your crush has to say and have a few stock questions in your quiver to jumpstart the conversation. These questions may include:”What have you been up to?””Have you seen the latest episode of _____?””What did you think of the test?””Do you know when the English assignment is due?””Are you going to the game tomorrow?”, Our fear of rejection is often crippling and debilitating. This fear often prevents us from taking risks, like talking to our crush. Instead of allowing the fear of the unknown to control your love life, step out of your comfort zone and talk to your crush.Don’t assume that if your crush really wanted to talk to you, they would start a conversation with you. Your crush may be feeling as insecure, shy, and unsure as you.Instead of waiting for your crush to make the first move, take charge and talk to your crush with confidence.If it turns out that your crush isn’t interested in you, at least you’ll never spend time wondering about what could have been.  When you talk to your crush, you want to present the best version of yourself.

"Don't be a jerk. Be yourself!,Try not to get into fights around the girl. Have a sense of humor. Let her have her girl time. Know how to ask her out. Don't immediately jump to girlfriend and boyfriend. Don't get physical too soon. Make the first move.",How to Know what Girls Like in Middle School and Get Them to Like You,"Being a jerk signals that you are a bully and you are not being yourself. , Don't fake who you really are, it forces the girl to not like you in an intimate way. She won't know who you really are.  If you are fighting make sure that it's not a petty reason. For example:Someone doesn't like your shoes.  Girls like boys who are funny, but not constantly. They don't like getting in trouble so don't always talk to them. Interact at times when you're allowed to. If you don't, it may be a turnoff. It also says that you can't be taken seriously. If you do get in trouble for talking, put the blame on yourself. It says that you are a gentleman. However, if the girl takes advantage of this, she is not the one.  Girls want to hang out with boys, but not all the time. They want to be with their friends too. So try not to: Interrupt her conversations, Follow her around, Sign up for all her classes,ETC.  If you want to ask the girl out, don't say, ""Do you want to go out with me?"" Try something more like... ""Hey, I'm going to see this movie on Friday, I think you'd like it."" When asking the question, don't use adjectives like fun and boring. These tell about your taste in the movie and that can be a kill. After she responds say something like, ""Wanna come?"" It works a lot easier and shows her that you want her to be in your life besides school.  Some girls aren't ready for that yet. They might prefer to be just friends and then work their way into a relationship. Make sure that the girl you are interested in does not have a boyfriend. If she does, distance the flirting but still remain friends. She will come around sometime.  Most girls secretly want to kiss a boy, but boys usually make the first move. If you ask them to kiss... they'll be clueless or think you might cause physical troubles later on in your relationship. After you both are comfortable with each other... then you can get into physical contact. Try not to touch parts of her body other than her face. It may seem as if you want something from her.

"Do the smile test. Start the conversation. Talk to her as much as possible. Listen carefully at all times. Become friends with her. Get to know about what kind of music she likes, her favorite TV show, her favorite celebrity, etc. Try the waist grab Test. Try the hug test. Try to hold her hand. Play with her hair. Do not flirt with other girls to see what her reaction is. Notice whether she tries to touch you. Notice her playing with her hair, rubbing her lips, looking at her nails, or fiddling with her fingers. Notice whether she makes eye contact while talking to you. Notice some typical responses from a person who might fancy you.",How to Know if Your Crush Likes You Back (for Guys),"If you look at her and she's already looking back at you, smile at her. Girls like it when the guy makes the first move. Hold the eye contact just for a second, then smile at her. If she likes you, she'll smile back. If she doesn't like you, she'll give you a weird look or turn away.Smile with your eyes and make sure you have white teeth and a nice breath.Don't use the smile test unless you guys know each other. Don't try this with a crush that doesn't know you.Note: a smile and a cheesy grin are not the same thing. A cute grin is okay. , Start with something simple like, ""Hey, how was your weekend?"" or if it's nearer the end of the week, ""Hey, got anything planned for this weekend?"".If she likes you, she'll keep the conversation going by asking you questions about your weekend- and you'll get into her life.If she just mumbles something like, ""It was fine"" and then goes back to what she was doing, she's probably not interested.  A lot of guys think that if they talk to a girl a lot then they'll think he's pathetic, or clingy, but that's just not true. Girls love it when you hang out with them and actually try to talk about all sorts of topics.  Try to relate to what she says, but don't try to be someone you're not.Don't daydream while she is talking, she'll hate that and find it a turn off.  This is vital before continuing on with the next steps. You can only keep testing her interest if you are good friends. So, become good friends!, Find out all that you can about stuff like that.If she likes you, this will turn into a conversation, because she'll ask you what your interests are too.If she doesn't like you, it will sound more like an interview. It sounds creepy if you're just sitting there asking her all these questions and she's responding with one-word answers. If this is the case, stop the ""conversation"" immediately.  Make sure you know each other a lot before you try this, or it will totally backfire!Sneak up on her from behind, and gently grab her waist. Don't squeeze her skin or anything, just put your hands on her waist and leave them there. She may freak out a little at this––remember, someone has just sneaked up on her and put their hands around her waist!If she jumps slightly or screams and turns round, say, ""It's only me!"" and then smile. Do not laugh. Keep your hands on her waist.If she likes you, she'll smile back and maybe giggle a little bit, then return to her original position. Your hands should still be on her waist. Notice whether or not she leans in closer to you. If she does, tighten your grip ever so slightly, but then let go.If she is not interested, she'll probably just laugh and walk away.If you two are shy friends, she'll probably ask why you're doing this, and how do you explain that? Have a ready answer prepared beforehand, such as ""I was just feeling affectionate"".  Note: only attempt this if the waist grab test was successful. Go up to her and hug her for no apparent reason. Make sure you hug her gently, not like you would with one of your guy friends. Put your hands on her upper back (steering well clear of her bra!) and slowly rub your hand in up-and-down or circular motions. If she's interested, she'll hug you back.Notice whether her chin is resting on your shoulder. If it is, there's some chemistry there. Rest your chin on her shoulder too, and bow your head a little bit so it looks like you're looking at the ground.If she doesn't hug you back and moves away, she's not interested.  If you're lucky enough to sit together in a class, attempt to hold her hand. But this has to be done very carefully. Make sure her hand is off the table and resting on her seat. If she's right handed, sit on the left side of her. If she's left handed, sit on the right side of her. Slowly move your hand towards hers and gently touch her wrist. She may jump a little at first; remember, this girl may like you.If she doesn't pull away, take your hand off her wrist and touch her hand. Attempt to hold her hand by slowly sliding your fingers in between hers. If she likes you, she will definitely hold your hand back.If she does, try to stay holding hands for the remainder of the lesson.  If she has a strand of hair in her face, gently tuck it behind her ear.If she's interested, she'll likely smile.If she's not interested, she'll likely move away.  If this girl does like you back, seeing you flirt with another girl will just make her feel stupid. She won't know you're doing it to see what her reaction is- she'll think you're doing it because you have a crush on the girl you're flirting with.  If you reach something out for her to take, see if she gently touches your hand before she takes it. This may be a sign of her eagerness to get closer to you.Beware: It could just mean she bumped you by accident.  These are all possible signs that she's nervous and may mean that she's interested in you.  If not, it could mean she is nervous, or just doesn't make eye contact, or doesn't like you.

Pay attention when she's around. Note if she likes to giggle with her friends. Watch her body language. See if she gets clumsy near you. Ask your friends what they think. Watch for signs on social media. Notice how often she's around. Pay attention to what your instinct is telling you. Pay attention to when her shyness hits. Use her friends to your advantage. Make eye contact. Smile at her. Make opportunities for her to talk to you. Say “hi.” It’s an easy first step and a way to acknowledge that you’re noticing each other. Think about how to start a conversation. Engage her in conversation.,How to Know if a Girl You Have Never Talked to Before Likes You,"If you two haven't met yet, and this girl likes you, then she may stare at you and smile to get your attention. Make sure you smile back, and watch her reaction. Shy girls may blush and outgoing girls may smile back. You're basically engaging in a little flirting.  If she notices you're around and she likes you, she may want to appear more interested in her friends, so she'll start laughing. She may also feel nervous when you're around, and many people giggle or laugh when they're nervous.  Does her face turn red when around you? She might stare at you for a long time, and smile when you look. Maybe when you look at her, she looks quickly away. These signs may mean she likes you. She may also look nervous because she has butterflies, meaning she likes you.  If you notice she seems to drop things when she's near you, that could be a sign she likes you. It could indicate she gets nervous when she's near you, causing her to drop things or be a bit clumsier.  Your friends may have heard whether the person likes you or not. Even if they haven't, they'll probably be better at guessing than you are. That's only because when it's you in the situation, you have a harder time stepping back and analyzing it, and you may feel a little self-conscious thinking about a girl liking you. Therefore, asking a good friend can help you analyze the situation better.  One way to see if a girl likes you is to watch how she treats you on social media. Of course, you first need to friend her. Once you do, watch how she interacts with you. If she seems to pay extra attention to you, she may like you. For instance, maybe she ""likes"" everything you post or tags you in a number of her posts.For instance, if she writes ""Cute!"" on a selfie you posted, it may be she's flirting with you.  If a girl likes you, she's going to find reasons to be near you. Even if you've never talked to her, you'll look up, and she'll be at the next table in the library or a few benches down at the basketball game. It's not that she's stalking you. Rather, she's probably hoping you'll notice her.This approach may include things like walking through your line of sight or talking to people near you.  If you're trying to figure out if someone likes you by analyzing everything she does, she may not be that into you. If someone likes you, you'll generally know it in your gut, with the exception of very shy people.However, if you're not sure, it's always best to give it a shot by talking to her. The worst she can say is ""No!"", If you notice that she seems to go up and talk to everyone, but avoids talking to you, she may just be nervous about talking to you. In other words, she doesn't talk to you because she likes you, and that makes her scared.  Another step you could take is to talk to one of her friends, particularly if you have a class with one of them. A simple, ""Hey, you're Jess's friend, right? Can I ask you something? Do you think Jess likes me?"" is really all you need.You can also watch how her friends react when you're around the whole group of them, including the girl you like. For instance, they may start whispering to each other, teasing the girl, or even pushing her in your direction.  See if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours. If she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it, chances are she’s interested in you. She may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks you're not looking.Of course, you don't want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy. Just glance in her direction, or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds.However, some girls are just shy, and they may not want to make eye contact with you. Try encouraging her with other steps.  Smiling shows your interest, and makes it easy for her to smile back at you. Sometimes, it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before you’re ready to actually talk to each other. Even if you’re nervous, smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people. In other words, when you smile at her, her brain perceives it as a reward, making her happier to be around you.  Don’t just hang around with the same group of friends. It’s much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone who's with a large group, so if you make sure you're alone sometime when she's around, she might come over and talk to you. You could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available. You never know what might happen.For instance, maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school. Make it a point to show up there, too. Try sitting at a table near her, where she can see you.  You don’t have to do much more at first if you’re shy. If she’s unwilling to say “hi” back, she might not be interested. Try it a few more times, but if she never responds, let it go.You might be nervous about approaching her, but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her.  If she’s responded to your greeting, you can move ahead to actually talking to each other. Consider what you know about her, as that can lead to a conversation. Is she part of the drama club, or does she play sports? Engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation. You could even try to be funny, but that can be hard.You could ask, ""Is your training on the track team really hard?"" or ""What did you think of the pep rally?""You could also say something like, ""Wasn't the food gross in the cafeteria today? Isn't it awful what they call food?"" or ""Don’t you think Mr. Harrison looks and sounds a lot like Yoda?"", Now that you have some possible questions, find a good time to talk to her. It should be a time when neither of you is hurrying off to class or activities, and hopefully when you’re both alone. It can feel really awkward the first time, but it does get easier. If she really responds and starts asking you questions too, chances are that she is interested in you. If she doesn’t really respond, it’s likely she’s not that into you.For example, if you asked whether her track training was hard, she might say, ""Yes, but I love it!"" In that case, you could say, ""Cool! What do you love about it? I've always thought about getting into running, but it seems really hard.""","[""If you two haven't met yet, and this girl likes you, then she may stare at you and smile to get your attention."",

Watch for signs. Be confident about how to react to her. When you ask her out be sure of yourself and almost insist that she join you for a bite to eat or a walk in the park.,How to Know if a Girl Likes You (20s+),"She doesn't mind you touching her. Try bumping into the girl, stand so that your arms touch, any kind of Kino will immediately be noticed (trust me she's a girl). Once they notice the touch, they have two choices, to either move or stay. If they stay, she is at least comfortable with you. ""5 Points""She is willing to hold eye contact. Assuming of course that this girl is not incredibly shy, if you can look her into the eyes while you are talking to her, and you find her staring directly back, only turning away occasionally to smile, then you are definitely making a good impression. ""2 Points""She always seems to have lip gloss on. Ok so, this is very key. As subtle as this one is, pretty much ""every"" girl does it. When a girl fantasizes about a guy, usually there is a lot of kissing involved. Whereas guys tend to skip the kiss and jump to the ravaging. If a girl is always keeping her lips nice and glossy around you, she is hoping that by the off chance a kiss does happen, she will be prepared. ""2 Points""She always keeps you in her vision range. The average person's field of vision is about 150 degrees. This means that at any time, a person sees about 40% of the activity around them. If you somehow always end up in that 40%, well. She probably likes you. “1 Point”She brings up things you guys have talked about. Yea, you forgot that you mentioned how much you enjoy fishing last week when you saw her. Now she is trying to invite you on a fishing trip with half the people on her contacts list. ""1 Point""She tries to get you to hang out with her best friend and her best friend's Boyfriend. AKA, she wants you for a double date but is too shy to ask for the ""date"". Even if it is just with her best friend, you're still pretty in. Think about it, would you show a horribly unattractive girl off to your best friend? Bonus points if this happens shortly after you meet her.

You'll notice that girls who like you will pay a lot of attention to any compliments you throw out and subconsciously adjust themselves accordingly. If you tell someone you love it when a girl wears blue and the next week she starts to look like a smurf, you are in. ""5 Points""She seems like she is always having a good time around you. When it comes down to it. This is the best indicator. Most girls in their 20s now start to realize that their lives aren't the exciting fairy tales they always thought they'd live.

But wait, every time she is with you, all these childhood delights seem to be coming back. She is in that naive bliss once again and you have done your job as a man. She has checked you off as a possible Provider, Protector, and Partner. ""10 Points""She never seems to have anything to do after seeing you. You know why? It's because she made sure of it. She didn't need an escape plan because she didn't plan on escaping. She cleared up her to-do's because she wanted to spend the entire day with you. If you didn't have to go home to save the world from an endless horde of Nazi Zombies, she would still be hanging out with you. ""3 Points""After she said she has no plans, she turns out to have a few. If for some reason you bump into her later in the day or go back because you forgot your phone, and it turns out that she ""is"" hanging out with somebody. That means that she had a bunch of people she ""wanted"" to see, but kept putting them off to spend more time with you alone.

See if she tries to talk about common interests. See if she looks for any excuse to talk to you. See if she teases you. See if she flirts with you. See if she asks who you like. Notice what she says to you over Facebook or texting.,How to Know if a Girl in Middle School Likes You3,"If she knows that the Warriors are your favorite basketball team and has suddenly started talking to you about them, then she may have picked up a new love for the team just because of you. If she knows you love watching Game of Thrones and suddenly knows everything about the characters, then she may just be trying to impress you with these new interests.If she's never shown an interest in your interests before but suddenly seems to know everything about the things you like, then she probably likes you.  If she approaches you and asks a question that you know she can easily get answered by someone else, like how hard the math test was, or what new sport you played in gym class, then she's clearly just looking for an excuse to talk to you. If she asks what you think of a certain teacher or the new kid in school, she's just trying to spend more time with you by asking any question that comes to her mind.  If the girl teases you, then it's almost definitely true that she likes you. If she makes fun of you, from laughing at your shoes, giggling at your new outfit, or makes a comment about how messy your locker is, then she's just teasing you because she likes to be around you. Sometimes, her teasing can even get a little mean, but that doesn't mean she doesn't like you.Just remember the golden rule: if she's paying attention to you, she likes you. Teasing is just one way of paying attention.  In middle school, teasing and flirting are almost interchangeable. Still, there are some signs that the girl is flirting with you. If she winks at you, even jokingly, she's definitely flirting. If she teases you about your new haircut and maybe even says it's an improvement, then she's flirting with you.If she acts coy, playful, or just a little bit silly around you, then she's flirting with you.If she makes fun of you for liking another girl, especially when you clearly don't like another girl, then she's just flirting with you.  If the girl is suddenly interested in who you like and if you want to ask any girl out, then she wants to know if you like her -- unless she's playing matchmaker for one of her friends. If she's always bugging you about who you like or even throws out some names of people she knows you don't really like, then she's just trying to talk to you about your romantic life to get close to you.If she makes fun of any girlfriends you've had in the past, or just makes fun of other girls around you, then she's probably just jealous because she really likes you.  Middle school girls love flirting over Facebook and texting. Remember the first rule: if she pays attention to you, then there's a good chance she likes you. If she's always texting you or posting on your Facebook wall for no reason, then she probably likes you.If she posts a video or a link to something you like on your Facebook wall, then it's even more likely that she likes you.If she asks what you're doing over the weekend when she texts you, then she's interested in you plans because she likes you.Check out her Facebook activity.

Ask her friends. Ask her yourself. React appropriately.,How to Know if a Girl in Middle School Likes You4,"Asking her friends is she likes you is a less bold way of basically telling her that you're interested in her yourself. Still, if you're feeling shy but really want to know how she feels without asking her directly, then just ask her friends how she feels about you. They probably won't tell you how she feels, but they'll make it obvious that she likes you by acting excited and saying that you should talk to her. They'll also tell her that you like her right away, so be careful.Her friends will, however, let you know if the girl doesn't like you and this will spare your feelings if she doesn't.  If you're feeling brave and really want to date this girl, then just find a time when you're alone together, like by your lockers after school, and ask her how she really feels about you. You can even admit that you like her first (if you do) and wait for her to respond. Don't put too much pressure on her -- just casually say that you've noticed that she might like you and that you want to know how she feels.You can even complement her a bit to put her at ease.  If she admits that she likes you and you like her too, you don't have to jump up and down for joy or you'll look uncool. Instead, just show her that you're excited that you both like each other and ask her if she wants to hang out some time. If she doesn't like you, don't be a jerk about it. Just say, ""Cool, it's no big deal,"" and act cool and calm as you say goodbye. This will show her that you're comfortable with yourself and who knows -- maybe she'll change her mind about you in the future.Whatever happens, remember that you're in middle school. Relationships in middle school are fun, but they're usually short and shouldn't be taken too seriously. Just try to have fun and if it doesn't work out with this girl, someone else will definitely fall for you.","[""Asking her friends is she likes you is a less bold way of basically telling her that you're interested in her yourself."", ""Still, if you're feeling shy but really want to know how she feels without asking her directly, then just ask her friends how she feels about you."", ""They probably won't tell you how she feels, but they'll make it obvious that she likes you by acting excited and saying that you should talk to her."", ""They'll also tell her that you like her right away, so be careful."", ""Her friends will, however, let you know if the girl doesn't like you and this will spare your feelings if she doesn't."", ""If you're feeling brave and really want to date this girl, then just find a time when you're alone together, like by your lockers after school, and ask her how she really feels about you."", 'You can even admit that you like her first (if you do) and wait for her to respond.', ""Don't put too much pressure on her -- just casually say that you've noticed that she might like you and that you want to know how she feels."", 'You can even complement her a bit to put her at ease.', ""If she admits that she likes you and you like her too, you don't have to jump up and down for joy or you'll look uncool."", ""Instead, just show her that you're excited that you both like each other and ask her if she wants to hang out some time."", ""If she doesn't like you, don't be a jerk about it."", 'Just say, ""Cool, it\'s no big deal,"" and act cool and calm as you say goodbye.', ""This will show her that you're comfortable with yourself and who knows -- maybe she'll change her mind about you in the future."", ""Whatever happens, remember that you're in middle school."", ""Relationships in middle school are fun, but they're usually short and shouldn't be taken too seriously."", ""Just try to have fun and if it doesn't work out with this girl, someone else will definitely fall for you.""]"
Pay attention to her body language around you. Watch for clues that she is trying to avoid you. Observe if she flirts with other guys. Pay attention to how her friends act while you’re around. Notice if she ever looks your way. Look at her eyes.,How to Know if a Girl Doesn't Like You Back1,"If you ever touch her, does she touch you back or does she avoid contact? When you talk, does she lean towards you? Does she open her shoulders up to your when you’re talking or does she keep her distance and remained reserved? These aren’t foolproof ways of knowing that she does or does not like you, but they can help you get an idea. Some girls might be more comfortable messing around with and touching guys even if they don’t like them. , If she avoids or finds excuses to get out of time that you would otherwise share together, she probably doesn’t like you. If she was thinking about how she liked you she would probably be making excuses to be around you more, not the other way around. Don’t take this as gospel – there is always the chance that she is really shy. However, if you find that she’s constantly scheduling her doctors appointments during the free period you have together that probably isn’t a good sign. , She might not be interested in you if she flirts with other guys, but she might be trying to make you jealous so don’t immediately assume the worst. There’s also no way to know if she’s really flirting with the guy or just being friendly.It is a good idea to see how much attention she pays to other guys versus how much attention she pays to you. Again, if she’s really shy she may be more comfortable talking to guys that she doesn’t like versus someone she does – maybe you!, Girls often tell their friends who they like. If her friends ever laugh at you or her, they might think it's funny that she likes you. They might act immaturely and tease you and her.Not all friends do this, but if you pay attention you might catch a friend winking at your crush or giving them an elbow nudge. Keep your eye out for these types of clues.  Sometimes when you like someone all you want to do is stare at him or her. If you catch her looking over at you often, she might like you. If she never even looks your way, she may be trying to hide the fact that she likes you. Or she could just be focused on her work. If you often make eye contact across the room that is a very, very good sign. , When the two of you talk she will probably make lots of eye contact if she is interested in you. She probably will smile often and pay attention to what you are saying too.","['If you ever touch her, does she touch you back or does she avoid contact?', 'When you talk, does she lean towards you?', 'Does she open her shoulders up to your when you’re talking or does she keep her distance and remained reserved?', 'These aren’t foolproof ways of knowing that she does or does not like you, but they can help you get an idea.', 'Some girls might be more comfortable messing around with and touching guys even if they don’t like them.', ', If she avoids or finds excuses to get out of time that you would otherwise share together, she probably doesn’t like you.', 'If she was thinking about how she liked you she would probably be making excuses to be around you more, not the other way around.', 'Don’t take this as gospel – there is always the chance that she is really shy.', 'However, if you find that she’s constantly scheduling her doctors appointments during the free period you have together that probably isn’t a good sign.', ', She might not be interested in you if she flirts with other guys, but she might be trying to make you jealous so don’t immediately assume the worst.', 'There’s also no way to know if she’s really flirting with the guy or just being friendly.', 'It is a good idea to see how much attention she pays to other guys versus how much attention she pays to you.', 'Again, if she’s really shy she may be more comfortable talking to guys that she doesn’t like versus someone she does – maybe you!, Girls often tell their friends who they like.', ""If her friends ever laugh at you or her, they might think it's funny that she likes you."", 'They might act immaturely and tease you and her.', 'Not all friends do this, but if you pay attention you might catch a friend winking at your crush or giving them an elbow nudge.', 'Keep your eye out for these types of clues.', 'Sometimes when you like someone all you want to do is stare at him or her.', 'If you catch her looking over at you often, she might like you.', 'If she never even looks your way, she may be trying to hide the fact that she likes you.', 'Or she could just be focused on her work.', 'If you often make eye contact across the room that is a very, very good sign.', ', When the two of you talk she will probably make lots of eye contact if she is interested in you.', 'She probably will smile often and pay attention to what you are saying too.']"
"Take a look at yourself and see what changes can be made. Listen to yourself when you talk. Be confident. Always be neat and clean with no bad boy image. Try to be friends with her. When you finally know your crush, try to attract her. After three or four such conversations, or till you feel that you two are pretty close, ask for her phone number, email address, etc. If you sense some signs that she likes you (ex: she gives you her phone number without you asking) and is more comfortable with you than any of the other guys, you might have succeeded. Try to hold longer conversations with her on the phone. After doing all this, if the girl notices you, move to the third level. If she asks you about a coffee, you should not always say yes to her. If your crush didn't ask you out, gather up all your courage and ask her - at least try your luck instead of staying quiet. The next and final step, you must be alone with her and say that you want to have an important talk. If she doesn't feel the same way, it's okay!,Whether you have won your crush's heart or not, know that you have tried your best and that's what counts.",How to Impress a High Class Girl,"If you tend to dress like a slob (ex: wrinkled, baggy untucked shirt, baggy pants, dirty sneakers), see what else you have in your wardrobe that may be more presentable. High class girls like boys who dress decently and neatly, but they must also have the ability to sweep them off their feet. Suggestions for clothing may be:A nice fitting shirt that complements your face, hair, eyes, etc.A nice fitting pair of pants that doesn't look off (jeans are also another option, but it depends on what kind of girl you're dealing with here)Combed hair (it doesn't have to look like you spent an hour on it, but messy bed hair may not be appealing to high class girls)A decent pair of shoes (it doesn't have to be dress shoes, but make sure your shoes aren't scruffy and dirty looking)The way you dress will depend on the preferences of the high class girl you're trying to win. If she tends to dress more casually, you can be a little more casual. However, if she dresses extravagantly and formally, you may have to lessen the casual look and go more for the formal look (but not too much). , High class girls tend to look down on bad words, lazy vocabulary and pretty much any styles of talking that sound dirty, low class and unruly. Listen to how your crush talks and try to talk like she does, but not so much that you sound like an exact replica of her! Pick up words from her here and there, and dust up your vocabulary. Refrain from cursing or doing any bad talk in front of her, and definitely keep away from dirty and/or perverted jokes.If you plan on telling her jokes, only tell her a couple that you know are uproariously funny to everyone, not just to your friends! Practice telling your jokes to other high class girls to see if they laugh; if they don't, you may have to rethink your jokes before presenting them to your crush!, Confidence goes a long way. If you appear shy and nervous in front of her, the chances of her being impressed by you will be extremely low. However, if you talk clearly - not too loudly or it will annoy her - and appear confident in who you are, she will be interested and want to know you more. Speak up and don't be afraid of who you are!Avoid practicing what you're going to say in front of her, as you will sound like you had prepared it. You will also sound mechanical and lifeless, almost like a parrot's words. Your conversations with her should be casual and flowing, not like stiff and resembling an interview!, High class girls dislike these types of boys. Remember to never try to be extremely cool. High class girls understand that you are not meant to be theirs.  Start a conversation with a girl who knows your crush, and converse with her about your crush. Tell that girl that you like your crush - she could act as a common friend!Never go and talk to your crush until that common friend introduces you to her.  Remember not to have personal talks with her that are direct. Either ask her about her hobbies, her favorite color, try to converse about what you two have in common, and so on. Slowly you will see that you two are sharing a good bond with each other.  However, make the question casual - ask her in the middle of a comfortable conversation and don't ask for all her personal information at once. Otherwise, she will see you as desperate and perhaps creepy.Don't forget to give her your email address, phone number, etc.Avoid asking for her address at this point. She may think you're trying to stalk her.Don't ask for all this information at once.If your crush wishes to tell, let her. If not, move onto the next step or wait a while before asking again. However, don't be pushy or whiny!,, Meet with her or say hi whenever she sees you. Always keep smiling (but not too much or creepily!), preferably when you're with your friends so that it attracts her attention.  Try to be or talk with other girls a little so that she will become a little jealous. You will notice the change in her.  Say yes if you have time. Otherwise, politely decline and say, ""Maybe another time. I'm busy after school.""If you always accept, it creates an image for the boy next door.  If she says no, do not get frustrated. Only say, ""Okay. Maybe another time?"" Always make eye contact with her and do not be shy. Girls don't like to talk to shy boys. You should be confident while asking her so that she is not able to easily say no.  Tell her that you like her. If she says that she feels the same way, great! Before starting a relationship with her, tell her about your reality and that you are a middle class boy - not a high class boy. If she accepts you the way you are, she really does love you.  You two can still be friends and she may realize in the future that she does love you. There are plenty of girls out there and the perfect one for you is waiting in the world - you have to let go of your crush for now in order to find her. It will be worth it.

Listen to what tone she talks to you with. Wait for her to strike up a conversation with you. Keep an eye out for verbal gestures. Keep track of how nice she is to you.,How to Know if a Girl Doesn't Like You Back2,"If you find that she’s on her best behavior when you are around that is a good sign. However, don’t take it to heart if she is brief with you sometimes. She might seem in a hurry or she might not want to be around you right at that moment. Sometimes she might just be grumpy or having a bad day. Pay attention the theme of your conversations, not one specific instance.For example, if she tries to engage you in interesting conversations then she probably thinks you are interesting.  If you're always the one to talk to her, she might assume she doesn’t have to put any work into the relationship. Talk to her a few times and then leave the door open for her to start a conversation with you. If she doesn’t then she probably doesn’t want to talk to you anymore. For example, if she asks you how your soccer game went or your piano recital it means she is paying attention to your interests. That's a good sign.  If she likes you, she might ask for help on a lot of things. She might ask you for help on the new homework in the hall, just so she can get closer to you.She might ask you a lot of questions about your interests. She might even just say something about how she’s excited you’ll be living in the same neighborhood next year, or something like that. Keep an eye out for these clues.If she is a straight A student, and she asks you for the history assignment, she probably already has it and she just wanted to talk to you. But be careful, she might really need help, so don't get your hopes up too high.  This sounds simple, but honestly sometimes the simplest clues are the most important ones. If she is nice to you and asks questions, she probably likes you. There’s a myth that sometimes girls will act mean to you to get your attention. That’s not true. They might tease you flirtatiously, but they aren’t going to outright insult you. Take the teasing in stride because it’s probably a good sign. For example, if she teases you for being late to school that day she might like you.

They will admire your bravery and wish that they had the guts to do something like that.Even if it’s just a girl who works at the bookstore, go up to her and see if she wants to get lunch with you sometime. The worst that happens is that they say no and they will probably be really flattered. If they say anything mean then they weren’t worth your time to begin with.For example, just ask her what she's doing for lunch tomorrow. Ask her if she would be up to grab some tacos with you. It's as easy as that!It might be a good idea to find out if she has a boyfriend. If she does, she probably is more interested in him than you. If she has a boyfriend, the best thing to do is lay off of her. If she doesn't have one, she could be interested in anyone!, This is another way of being direct and finding out the answer to your question. However, the benefit of this method is that you don’t have to follow through on a date and neither do they! If you’re on the younger side a date is a difficult thing to accomplish, just asking if they like you is a good way to start. You can build from there after your question has been answered.You don't have to say ""do you like me"". Try telling her that you feel like you guys have a really good connection and you find yourself wondering if it might be something more than friendship. Then ask what she thinks.  This isn’t the bravest way to go about it, but it might work. Try to choose one of her friends who you are close to also. If the friend knows you are a good person they might be willing to help you out and tell you the truth. It might be hard to hear, but at least you won’t be constantly worrying about if she likes you or not. If they refuse to answer then that’s probably a good sign! However, the friend also might just say that they don’t know.","['Even if it’s scary this will answer a lot of your questions.', 'Stop snooping around trying to guess her every intention.', 'Everyone will respect you if you go up and ask her on a date.', 'They will admire your bravery and wish that they had the guts to do something like that.', 'Even if it’s just a girl who works at the bookstore, go up to her and see if she wants to get lunch with you sometime.', 'The worst that happens is that they say no', 'and they will probably be really flattered.', 'If they say anything mean then they weren’t worth your time to begin with.', ""For example, just ask her what she's doing for lunch tomorrow."", 'Ask her if she would be up to grab some tacos with you.', ""It's as easy as that!It might be a good idea to find out if she has a boyfriend."", 'If she does, she probably is more interested in him than you.', 'If she has a boyfriend, the best thing to do is lay off of her.', ""If she doesn't have one, she could be interested in anyone!"", ', This is another way of being direct and finding out the answer to your question.', 'However, the benefit of this method is that you don’t have to follow through on a date and neither do they!', 'If you’re on the younger side a date is a difficult thing to accomplish, just asking if they like you is a good way to start.', 'You can build from there after your question has been answered.', 'You don\'t have to say ""do you like me"".', 'Try telling her that you feel like you guys have a really good connection and you find yourself wondering if it might be something more than friendship.', 'Then ask what she thinks.', 'This isn’t the bravest way to go about it, but it might work.', 'Try to choose one of her friends who you are close to also.', 'If the friend knows you are a good person they might be willing to help you out and tell you the truth.', 'It might be hard to hear, but at least you won’t be constantly worrying about if she likes you or not.', 'If they refuse to answer then that’s probably a good sign!', 'However, the friend also might just say that they don’t know.']"
Be a gentleman. Figure out your intentions. Get close. Develop an excellent sense of humor. Confidence is key. Leave her wanting more. Don't tell her about her looks. But do compliment her. Hide in plain sight. Friendly get togethers.,How to Impress a Girl Who's Way out of Your League,"Don't pretend to be jerk so that you can impress her. Both lying about your true self and being rude will put distance between you and the girl.However, don't be afraid to tease her a bit. Once you've talked a few times, most girls will be comfortable with you making a few lighthearted jokes at her expense (as long as it's a two way street and she can do the same to you). It shows that you're confident enough in yourself to make a small gamble that she could be offended. If she takes a joke seriously and is offended, just apologize calmly and let her know you were only kidding. , First, ask yourself why you want to impress this girl. Is it because she is the most popular girl in school, or because you truly enjoy her company?, Hang out near her and listen to what the girl and her friends are saying. (Don't make it a dead giveaway that you're listening.) Then approach them and say, ""I couldn't help over hearing BLAH BLAH BLAH"". It should go naturally; if not then perhaps you should rethink this girl. Chemistry matters!, Beautiful girls don't look around and see faces as attractive as their own - they see YOUR face and others like it. But they DO appreciate someone who makes them laugh. Be optimistic and cheerful.  You've seen people walk around with their heads hanging, shuffling their feet as they walk. They look beaten, unhappy, defeated. That isn't attractive to anyone! If you want to attract a woman who's out of your league, then show her you're confident. Hold your head up, walk like you're proud to be you, delighted with who you are - but not arrogant, maintain eye contact if talking to her. Watch how others walk and carry themselves and try to mimic the confident behaviors you see.  Don't wait for her to break the conversation off the first few times. Keep conversations short, interesting and active, and then go away. Let her know you have to go (she doesn't need to know why), wish her a good day, and walk away.  Find out what other qualities she has that make her an outstanding woman. Ask her about herself and who she is. Women who are used to being noticed for their outer appearance won't be swayed easily by comments on their physical appearance. Be different and find the inner beauty (you can still admire the outer beauty in your own thoughts).  Did she do an awesome job on her speech in history? Let her know, and be genuine. Highlight some parts that you enjoyed or tell her about an article you read on the topic.  Sometimes, you meet and upon spending a little time with a girl, realize you have very strong feelings for her that you won't be able to hide. Don't. Just keep it light and start hitting on her immediately. If you make a little joke of it and say things like, ""She's crazy about me,"" or ""Of course I'm staring at you, you're the girl of my dreams."" (wiggles eyebrows up and down suggestively with a big, cheesy smile for her)to her friends while she's standing right there, it will just be part of the way you get along very early on. But careful: if she doesn't giggle or seem amused and a little bit flattered, this will not work and will become tiresome very quickly. Watch for her reaction and adjust.  Ask her out on a friendly date so you can see how much you guys really have in common. And if she is conceited then you will be grateful you didn't ask her out on a real date.Be very cautious to only do the ""friendly date"" once or twice. If you do it too much, she'll start to look at your relationship as friendship, and this can be a difficult perception to reverse.","[""Don't pretend to be jerk so that you can impress her."", 'Both lying about your true self and being rude will put distance between you and the girl.', ""However, don't be afraid to tease her a bit."", ""Once you've talked a few times, most girls will be comfortable with you making a few lighthearted jokes at her expense (as long as it's a two way street and she can do the same to you)."", ""It shows that you're confident enough in yourself to make a small gamble that she could be offended."", 'If she takes a joke seriously and is offended, just apologize calmly and let her know you were only kidding.', ', First, ask yourself why you want to impress this girl.', 'Is it because she is the most popular girl in school, or because you truly enjoy her company?,', 'Hang out near her and listen to what the girl and her friends are saying.', ""(Don't make it a dead giveaway that you're listening.)"", 'Then approach them and say, ""I couldn\'t help over hearing BLAH BLAH BLAH"".', 'It should go naturally; if not then perhaps you should rethink this girl.', 'Chemistry matters!', "", Beautiful girls don't look around and see faces as attractive as their own - they see YOUR face and others like it."", 'But they DO appreciate someone who makes them laugh.', 'Be optimistic and cheerful.', ""You've seen people walk around with their heads hanging, shuffling their feet as they walk."", 'They look beaten, unhappy, defeated.', ""That isn't attractive to anyone!"", ""If you want to attract a woman who's out of your league, then show her you're confident."", ""Hold your head up, walk like you're proud to be you, delighted with who you are - but not arrogant, maintain eye contact if talking to her."", 'Watch how others walk and carry themselves and try to mimic the confident behaviors you see.', ""Don't wait for her to break the conversation off the first few times."", 'Keep conversations short, interesting and active, and then go away.', ""Let her know you have to go (she doesn't need to know why), wish her a good day, and walk away."", 'Find out what other qualities she has that make her an outstanding woman.', 'Ask her about herself and who she is.', ""Women who are used to being noticed for their outer appearance won't be swayed easily by comments on their physical appearance."", 'Be different and find the inner beauty (you can still admire the outer beauty in your own thoughts).', 'Did she do an awesome job on her speech in history?', 'Let her know, and be genuine.', 'Highlight some parts that you enjoyed or tell her about an article you read on the topic.', ""Sometimes, you meet and upon spending a little time with a girl, realize you have very strong feelings for her that you won't be able to hide."", ""Don't."", 'Just keep it light and start hitting on her immediately.', 'If you make a little joke of it and say things like, ""She\'s crazy about me,"" or ""Of course I\'m staring at you, you\'re the girl of my dreams.""', ""(wiggles eyebrows up and down suggestively with a big, cheesy smile for her)to her friends while she's standing right there, it will just be part of the way you get along very early on."", ""But careful: if she doesn't giggle or seem amused and a little bit flattered, this will not work and will become tiresome very quickly."", 'Watch for her reaction and adjust.', 'Ask her out on a friendly date so you can see how much you guys really have in common.', ""And if she is conceited then you will be grateful you didn't ask her out on a real date."", 'Be very cautious to only do the ""friendly date"" once or twice.', ""If you do it too much, she'll start to look at your relationship as friendship, and this can be a difficult perception to reverse.""]"

Remember important information like birthday's, holidays and promises to hang out. Be her biggest cheerleader. Give your girl presents. Don't show off. Remember to be yourself. Try to be involved in a lot of different things. Get good grades in school. Try to be generally polite. Be normal buddies!,When you think that you and your new friend are close enough to take it to the next level, go ahead and map her realize you like her. Don't brand bash.",How to Impress a Girl by and Still Be Polite,"Talk to her in a friendly and casual way. You don't have to make it obvious that you like her, try just being friends first. While talking, be confident. Most likely, she's nervous too! Most girls will appreciate a guy that takes the lead. That way, they don't have to stutter and mumble their way into a conversation. , Don't dress like a slob in a baggy chili stained sweatshirt and sweat pants, but don't wear a suit and tie everyday either! It's also important to smell good. Wear a scent that isn't too strong, and don't spray it on too heavy. There's nothing worse than the girl you like being covered in your cologne after she talks with you!, Some girls are more confident than others, and some will take them well and some won't. If your girl is on the less than confident side, don't attempt a joke about her appearance. She might take you seriously and think you're a jerk. Also, make sure that your jokes are actually funny! If you are talking about that hard math test, don't relate it to your friend's pet turtle. It not only be a mood killer, but just plain awkward.  Maybe you're both book or band geeks, or love the same movie. If your girl is into something that you're not, try to be open minded about it. For example, if she likes painting, grab a brush and try it with her. You could also try something new to both of you! If you both have never tried photography, take a class together. Something you thought of before as stupid or boring could actually turn out to be really fun! Another thing to try would be dancing classes. Dancing is classically romantic, and taking a class will set the mood without being too obvious.  It's pretty embarrassing to show up without a present or at least something to say when it's a special day.  Go to her sporting events, recitals, concerts, art shows and performances. It's important to encourage her hobbies and interests by attending to show that you care.  It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a stuffed animal, or a card. Maybe you don't have a lot of money to spend. That's okay! Just a heartfelt letter can be enough. Don't make a big deal of it either. Just slip something in her locker, or send her a text or an email. Even a cheery, ""Happy birthday!"" the next time you see her will make her pleased that you remembered.  It comes off as annoying, or even conceited when guys constantly brag. It doesn't hurt to mention something about your football practice the other day, but don't constantly say things like, ""Since I'm the star on the football team, this will be no problem!"", When guys always follow whatever the new trend is, they start to be less like themselves and more and more like other people. It's good for the world to have differences because if everyone in the world were the same, life would be really boring! Don't be someone you're not just to impress her. If she doesn't like you for you, she's not the right girl for you.  Sports are fun and healthy activities to be involved in, and help make you a well rounded person. But remember that it's good to be involved in more than just sports. There are a wide range of activities to choose from including music, theatre, dancing, photography, visual arts, singing, playing an instrument, book clubs, environment clubs, wood shops, writing workshops and countless others. Being involved will show your girl that you know how to live life to the fullest!, It's good to remember to stay focused on schoolwork because it will benefit you in the future. Girls also enjoy studying with guys, and it's a good way to spend quality time with the girl you like.  Don't talk with your mouth full, and remember to use a napkin. When meeting her parents, say please and thank you. Don' burp, pass gas, sneeze or cough, don't do it in front of her. If you absolutely have to, leave the room for a moment. Sometimes this happens accidentally, and that can be really embarrassing! Just say excuse me and move on. Try to avoid making a joke unless she laughs. Then it's okay. Otherwise, It's just rude and disgusting.  Treat the girl you like as if she were any other friend at first. Don't be afraid to punch her on the arm, give her a high five, or give her a hug. None of these things have to be ""romantic"", so there shouldn't be any difference. Once you and your girl start to become closer, than you can start with the romantic stuff.  Don't go crazy and start bringing her flowers, but try to be subtle. When you two are alone and happy, lightly brush your hand against hers. Look at her face to see if she responds well. If she still looks happy, gently take hold of her hand. Be gentle, and don't make a big deal out of it. If she seems uncomfortable, let go. Most likely, she will be happy that you were brave enough to map the first move, and might be more comfortable seeing you as a romantic partner rather than a friend. If your girl is still responding well, put your arm around her. If she likes that, it's all downhill from there.  E.g.  do not tell her ""GM>tomboy-made Nissan"" or ""Nissan>recall-esque GM"". This'll get her NOT to like you.","['Talk to her in a friendly and casual way.', ""You don't have to make it obvious that you like her, try just being friends first."", 'While talking, be confident.',

"Don't try to impress. Bring forth your real talents, the ones that define who you are, not what you own or want to possess. Show your true self while trying to impress a girl and try to be your best self. Flirt and use body language to show your interest in her. Be kind, thoughtful and considerate. Communicate clearly and often. Be dependable and caring. Treat her as well as you'd treat a good mate, only better. Stay in touch.",How to Impress a Girl You Fancy,"Perhaps this is the biggest secret but really, it's the clincher. The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her. Now you might be wondering how this really works. The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girls, they tend to become less authentic and when this happens, they can try to show off with almost anything and everything. Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the ""show off"" category, unimpressed by the antics and bravado. The best way to impress a girl is to be yourself, let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates. , If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the time, then you are mistaken. The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself. You need girls to respect you for who you are.If the girl is impressed by your money, then she is probably looking for money and not you, so that's a good telltale sign to back off.  Don't talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do. One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality. Try to develop your intellectual skills. This can be done by the way to reading books, quality online articles and being up-to-date with the latest happenings. Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl.Have something which is different from the rest. Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all they’ve got. If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those men, then you won't succeed in your quest to impress girls.  Avoid being erotic or crass, that just scares girls off. Make it clear that you like her.If she is insecure, anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow. When you take your time, it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly.  The way to melt a girl's heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs. Notice the person she really is and compliment that, not her looks, clothes or ""hotness"". Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personality, intelligence, style and creativity.Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail.Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself; she will feel appreciated when it's noticed.Buy her a gift, like chocolate; it doesn't have to be special or expensive, it's the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush.If she is cold, or just for fun, give her your sweatshirt or coat––it has your smell and she will like to wear it.  There's nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guys, even if there is an age difference.Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of you, but let her do more of the talking to begin with, to allow you to learn about her.Don't tell tall stories to try to impress her. She'll see through it and you'll come across looking daft.  Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promise-keeper. If you can't do something you said you'd do, tell her the truth, don't make up stories.Girls love a guy who cares about her, and who won't make fun of her if she's in a bad situation.  Be playful in a fun and kind way. Also be wary of the following:Don't make her feel awkward when she is with you.Don't be a jerk. Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like.Don't be a horndog and make comments about ""doin' it"" with her; that's an immediate turnoff. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't don't want to do with you.Don't brag about what you've done in intimacy with her to your mates. That's a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too.  Call or contact her at least once a day when you see her, and twice when you don't. It helps her to feel special.","[""Perhaps this is the biggest secret but really, it's the clincher."", 'The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her.', 'Now you might be wondering how this really works.', 'The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girls, they tend to become less authentic and when this happens, they can try to show off with almost anything and everything.', 'Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the ""show off"" category, unimpressed by the antics and bravado.', 'The best way to impress a girl is to be yourself, let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates.', ', If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the time, then you are mistaken.', 'The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself.', 'You need girls to respect you for who you are.', ""If the girl is impressed by your money, then she is probably looking for money and not you, so that's a good telltale sign to back off."", ""Don't talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do."", 'One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality.', 'Try to develop your intellectual skills.', 'This can be done by the way to reading books, quality online articles and being up-to-date with the latest happenings.', 'Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl.', 'Have something which is different from the rest.', 'Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all they’ve got.', ""If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those men, then you won't succeed in your quest to impress girls."", 'Avoid being erotic or crass, that just scares girls off.', 'Make it clear that you like her.', 'If she is insecure, anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow.', 'When you take your time, it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly.', ""The way to melt a girl's heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs."", 'Notice the person she really is and compliment that, not her looks, clothes or ""hotness"".', 'Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personality, intelligence, style and creativity.', 'Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail.', ""Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself; she will feel appreciated when it's noticed."", ""Buy her a gift, like chocolate; it doesn't have to be special or expensive, it's the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush."", 'If she is cold, or just for fun, give her your sweatshirt or coat––it has your smell and she will like to wear it.', ""There's nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guys, even if there is an age difference."", 'Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of you, but let her do more of the talking to begin with, to allow you to learn about her.', ""Don't tell tall stories to try to impress her."", ""She'll see through it and you'll come across looking daft."", 'Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promise-keeper.', ""If you can't do something you said you'd do, tell her the truth, don't make up stories."", ""Girls love a guy who cares about her, and who won't make fun of her if she's in a bad situation."", 'Be playful in a fun and kind way.', ""Also be wary of the following:Don't make her feel awkward when she is with you."", ""Don't be a jerk."", 'Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like.', 'Don\'t be a horndog and make comments about ""doin\' it"" with her; that\'s an immediate turnoff.', ""Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't don't want to do with you."", ""Don't brag about what you've done in intimacy with her to your mates."", ""That's a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too."", ""Call or contact her at least once a day when you see her, and twice when you don't."", 'It helps her to feel special.']"
Plan your approach. Be well dressed and groomed. Meet her gaze. Stand up straight and tall. Keep it short and direct. Shrug it off if she says no.,How to Impress a Girl and Make Her Fall in Love with a Boy2,"Asking a girl out on a date can be frightening, but if you make a plan it might not be as scary. Think about when, where, and how you plan to ask her out. Try to work out what you want the moment to look like and spend some time visualizing a positive response.  You want to look your best when you ask her out for the first time. If you are wearing your grubbiest shirt and haven’t showered in a couple of days, she will not have a good impression of you. But you don’t need to wear a tuxedo or get a makeover before you ask her out either. Just make sure that you are clean, wearing some flattering clothes, and that your hair and facial hair are groomed.  Confidence is sexy, and one of the most confident things you can do is look her in the eyes when you ask her out. While it may feel more comfortable to look at the floor and mumble your question to her, this will not impress her. Look her straight in the eyes and hold your head up high to show her that you are confident.  The way that you stand can also indicate how confident you are. If you are slumping or crossing your arms, she might interpret this as fear or nervousness. Instead, stand up tall with your arms hanging loosely at your sides. Keep your shoulders back and your chest puffed out a bit. This will show her your full height and breadth, which will be much more impressive than if you approach her in a hunched over position.  There’s no need to talk to her for an hour before you ask her out. In fact, if you take too long to ask, you might lose your nerve. Instead, walk right up to her, give her a quick compliment, and then tell her that you’d like to spend some time with her.If you’d rather call her, that’s fine too, just don’t ask her out via Facebook or text message or she may think that you are too nervous to talk to her.Try saying something like, “Hi. You seem really cool! Listen, I am in a bit of a hurry, but I thought I’d see if you would be interested in going out with me sometime. Can I get your number?”, Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a girl will say no when you try to ask her out. The occasional “No” is something that you will have to deal with when you ask a girl out on a date.If she says no, don’t get upset. Just shrug it off, and try not to act like too disappointed.Try saying something like, “It’s cool. You just seem like a fun person to chill with so I thought I’d ask. But no worries!

Be an amazing date. Compliment her. Talk about safe subjects at first. Ask more questions to get to know her even better. Keep seeing her and be patient.,How to Impress a Girl and Make Her Fall in Love with a Boy3,"If the girl that you like says yes and you do get to go on a date with her, make sure that you do all that you can to make sure that she wants to go out again sometime.

Talk to her. Listen to her. Laugh at her jokes. Compliment her. Sit next to her in class. Be helpful. Listen to her problems. Comfort her when she is sad. Stare at her. Flirt with her. Don't flirt with other girls. Invite her over. Chat with her online. Remember her birthday. Give her a phone call. Tell her how you feel (If you're gutsy enough).,How to Give Easy to Notice Signs to a Girl You Like,"Saying ""Hi (name)"" and smiling as you pass her is a good way of doing this. Ask her questions about herself (e.g. ""How are you?"", ""How did you go on the maths test?""). Be friendly. , When she talks to you, show interest in what she has to say. Make eye contact. Try to keep the conversation flowing.  Even if they are lame.  Give her compliments like ""Your hair looks nice today,"" or ""That's a pretty dress."" Every girl loves a compliment. , If she drops something, pick it up for her. If she doesn't understand a math question, explain it to her.  Sometimes a girl just needs someone to talk to about something bringing her down. Sympathize with her.If she brings up an issue of hers, make sure you listen attentively, and offer constructive advice (but don't over-do the advice).  If she is upset, be there for her. If you're good friends with her, hug her (don't do this if you think she definitely doesn't like you).  Don't over-do this step, but occasionally let her catch you staring at her from afar. When she notices you staring, you can either smile (or wink if you think you can pull it off) or quickly look away.  Playfully teasing her, poking her (gently), and stealing her pen from her are effective and easy ways of signalling to a girl you like her. If you want to take it up a notch, gently make contact with her hand.(You can incorporate this in other types of flirting, e.g. if you steal her pen, hold it in your hand so that if she wants her pen back she has to pry it from your hand). Also don't overdo it, the girl may get annoyed.  This gives her mixed signals, often resulting in her constantly questioning whether you like her or not.  Show her that you want to socialize more with her. Ask her to the movies, to hang out with some friends, or ask her over to your house.  And comment on some of her photos/wall posts on Facebook/Myspace but don't overdo this.  If you don't know when it is, ask (by casually bringing it up in conversation). Give her a card or a small present on her birthday, or maybe even a hug.  Every now and then, ring her, just to talk with her and see how she's doing.  This is quite obvious, but it gets the message across.

You may need to crack a few more jokes than usual in order to get her laughing, but making her feel comfortable with you should be your top priority right now.It may be hard to act as if the awkwardness doesn't exist, but after a while, it won't exist at all if you try hard enough. However, avoid going overboard and acting fake. A fake smile and stiff words will take you nowhere, and it may worsen the situation.Make no mention of your feelings for her. Although you may be curious, don't ask her how she feels about you. At this point, she may feel very confused, insecure, and uncomfortable. You don't want her to start avoiding you because this could lead to the death of your relationship with her.Keep romance out of your conversations and interactions with her. While the temptation to flirt with her remains, resist it at least until she settles down and is relaxed with you once more.  Despite the circumstances and how insecure you both may feel, act happy and go about your life normally. Happiness and smiles tend to be contagious, and you may be able to smooth out your relationship with her even faster if you have a joyful, bright attitude that makes her smile and laugh. However, avoid going overboard and acting extremely crazy. Unless if she is used to your insane behavior, you should refrain from this behavior at this point because you might unintentionally scare her off.  This will show that you have an interest in the conversation and what she is saying. Also, it will make her feel comfortable because she has the assurance that someone is listening to her. However, avoid staring at her or she might feel uncomfortable, but remember not to look bored or look away too often. Find a healthy amount of eye contact in order to benefit both you and her.  Although you have the option of sitting directly next to her, you may also choose to occupy the seat behind her or in front of her. Don't feel limited when it comes to your seating options. While you may believe that sitting next to her is the only way to get her attention, remember that sitting behind her and in front of her hold their own advantages as well. Use your seat near her as an opportunity to talk to her and work together with her. However, be familiar with the appropriate times to speak in order to avoid getting her in trouble.One way to get her attention is to immediately take the blame if the teacher catches both of you talking. Not only will she feel grateful towards you, but she'll also think of you as a kind person, especially if you already are kind towards her. However, avoid treating her as if she is helpless because she'll only feel annoyed.If you sit near her, you'll have the chance to ask her to work with her on group projects and assignments. However, avoid asking her too frequently in order to give her the chance to work with her friends and other students she may want to interact with.Even if she rejects your offer, know that the thought counts. Try again another time when she seems in a good mood.Having a good relationship with her can increase your chances of being accepted.If she constantly rejects your offer, know when to stop asking her. This shows that she may not be interested in you. Stop before she has to ask you to stop.  It helps if you perform better in those classes than her, but remember not to act as if you are better than her or know more than her. Although one of the two may be true, you should never make her feel bad about herself. You want to make her feel good about herself when she is around you. Then, she'll want to be with you more often.Only offer to tutor her if she asks you or complains about the poor grades she is receiving in the class. Depending on the type of person she is, she may take your kind offer as an insult, and she may refuse to speak to you afterwards.If she accepts your offer to study with her/tutor her, make your times with her comfortable and memorable. Treat her as if she was a good friend. Avoid staring at her or inserting romance and flirting into your interactions with her. You'll make her feel uncomfortable, and she may not want to study with you.She may feel surprised at first if you treat her like a good friend, but she'll eventually get used to it and enjoy it. Use this method to become good friends with her quickly.  You may have to start most of the conversations at first, but once she gets used to talking to you every day, she'll eventually start the conversations without you having to approach her first. However, if she is shy, she may enjoy talking to you, but she may not have enough courage to approach you. Know that it is not you she is avoiding, but she may be too shy.During these conversations, subtly read her body language. Note how comfortable she feels and the physical contact she makes with you (ex: touching your arm or shoulder while laughing at your jokes). Run her words through your mind and search for any hints of her feelings for you.Remember to have a healthy amount of eye contact with her.End the conversation before it turns into an awkward silence. While you don't want to abruptly end it at the wrong time, make sure you finish it in a polite manner when it is still good. Although you may not want to end it, it's best that you may her look forward to the future conversations since they all end on a good note. It may take a few conversations and some practice before you know when to perfectly end it, but keep persisting till you understand.Have a good excuse when you end it so that suspicion and hurt feelings don't rise within her when you leave. Always end it in a friendly manner while showing you enjoyed talking to her and would like to have another conversation with her (ex: ""It was nice talking to you, but I have to finish my chores now"" or ""Let's continue this conversation another time. I don't want to be late for class!"").  This step should be performed only when you two have gotten to know each other well enough. Invite your friends to the movies along with her, but make sure she is not the only girl in order to avoid making her feel uncomfortable or insecure. Select a movie you know she would enjoy or ask her to choose one. Before the movie starts, purchase a separate drink for her if you wish - do not share a drink with her - and a bag of popcorn for you both to share. If you offer to share the popcorn with her before the movie starts, the chances of you being able to sit next to her increase. During the movie, make sure you occupy the seat next to her. One way to ensure that the seat is yours is to follow her behind. That way, you'll know where she is sitting, and you'll be close enough to immediately sit down next to her.Avoid selecting romantic movies because it may lead to her to remember that you like her, and she may feel extremely uncomfortable. Select a comedy or an action movie to get you all laughing.Act like a gentleman. This includes opening the doors for her and allowing her to go ahead of you. However, avoid acting as if she is helpless because this will only annoy her and make her feel bad about herself.Your conversations with her afterwards can consist of the movie and whether she enjoyed it or not.Afterwards, invite her to other group outings, but make sure they don't occur too frequently in order to give her the opportunity to attend other outings she would like to go to. If you play sports, invite her to your games, even if you know she doesn't enjoy watching sports. She may appear at your games just to support you if she has feelings for you.  However, make sure your gifts for her are not sappy or romantic. They should be the type of gifts that make her smile and enjoy them. An example would be to purchase her the CD album she has always wanted.If you want to give her a gift on Valentine's Day, make sure your gift isn't romantic. Avoid going to elaborate lengths and making her feel uncomfortable. Instead, purchase an object as simple as a cute teddy bear.  Not only is this sweet, but this will make her feel more comfortable. She will have enough time to respond as she pleases, and she'll also have more time to sort through her thoughts and feelings. She may be able to come up with an answer that is better than the answer she may give you if you ask her right on the spot. She'll be able to think logically and ask for needed advice, and the choice that she makes will be much wiser and healthy for both of you, depending on her personality.Add a small spritz of your cologne onto the letter so that it leaves a faint, pleasant smell. This will instantly make her think of you, and it'll be harder for her to get you out of her mind.Avoid adding too much cologne so that it creates an overwhelmingly powerful smell. Annoyance may prickle her, and she may dislike you.  This requires a lot of courage and bravery, which will make her think twice before answering you. She might feel impressed if you yourself approach her, and she won't think of you as a coward. However, make sure you ask about her feelings for you in an area where she feels comfortable, but make sure no one is listening to your conversation.  because it is less intimate, and she may think of you as a coward since you have a screen to hide yourself behind.  Not only will you appear as a coward, but she'll also feel more intimidated because your friend might tell others about her answer. Pressure may influence her into making a bad choice or sharing her true feelings for her. This may lead her to come up with a lie or a sharp answer to discourage you from pursuing her.  Not only will she be unaware of who her secret admirer is, but she'll also be uncertain of who to reply to. Leaving yourself as anonymous tends to be cowardly, and it can make her feel annoyed. She may end up trashing the letter or leaving no response because she won't know who sent the letter or how to answer.If you send her another letter in the future and sign it, she may connect the dots and instantly know it was you who wrote the anonymous letter. She may dislike you because of your cowardly move, and you will not leave a good impression upon her.","['Ask a friend that she is not entirely unknown to her, to ask her if ""she"" likes you.',

Relax your body. Make eye contact. Smile. Start a simple conversation. Join extracurricular activities. Meet girls through others. Share your thoughts and feelings. Talk on social media. Ask questions. Invite a girl to hang out. Rehearse what you want to say. Write down conversation starters. Discuss your fears with friends and family. Practice socializing.,How to Get to Know Girls in Your School,"If you want to make contact with a girl you like, first try and relax your body. You want to make sure you don't communicate nervousness or defensiveness, as this may put a girl on edge. Try to stay calm going into the conversation.If you're nervous, you may lean forward and dip your chin down slightly. This can make you look aggressive. Try to be aware of your posture.Make sure your chin is straight and level. Keep your hands and arms loose at your side, or put your hands in your pocket. This will help make you look relaxed and nonchalant. This will make you look approachable. , Another good way to initiate contact is eye contact. Eye contact can help convey interest and allow you to initiate a conversation. If you're interested in getting to know a girl from your class, try starting off with eye contact. Try to catch a girl's eye and hold her gaze for a few moments before looking away.However, be careful not to stare. This can come off as creepy. Try to make and hold hold eye contact briefly. If a girl is not returning your eye contact after a few seconds, look away and try again. You do not want it to look like you're staring.  A calm and friendly smile is a great way to grab someone's attention. Once you've made eye contact, try smiling. Try to think about something that genuinely makes you happy when you're smiling. You want your smile to look real and genuine, as a fake smile can easily give you away.  Once you've gotten a girl's attention, you should make an effort to make conversation. It can be stressful to make conversation with someone you don't know, but with a quick observation or introduction you should be able to start a conversation.Start by introducing yourself. You can simply say something like, ""Hi, I'm Paul."" It may feel a little awkward, but if this is someone you see in class a lot, it's perfectly acceptable to introduce yourself.Try to open with an observation. When you're in school, there's a lot to observe and comment on. You could talk about the upcoming test or make an observation about what happened in class today. Try to give the girl the opportunity to share by posing an observation as a question. For example, don't just say, ""Wow, that was a crazy test last week."" Instead, say, ""Wow, that was a crazy test last week, right?"" This invites the girl to share her opinion as well.  During the average school day, it may be hard to stop and make conversation with a girl. However, if you join some extracurriculars, you may find it's easier to find people with common interests. Extracurriculars also provide you with the opportunity to socialize and make friends. This can help you meet girls.Find an after school club that caters to your interests and includes members of both genders. You're unlikely to meet girls on a boy's sports team. However, something like the school newspaper may help.The advantage of meeting people through a club is that you'll automatically have something in common. If you sometimes struggle to make conversation, you'll have something to discuss right away.  One of the easiest ways to establish a connection to someone else is through another person. It's easier to feel close and relaxed around someone if you meet in a casual social setting. If you have any friends who are close to girls in your school, mention you would like to try to meet some girls. See if that friend can invite you to parties and events where his female friends will be present.  In order to get to know someone, you need to share your thoughts and feelings with that person. Long talks in which you communicate openly are what foster the closeness that forms a friendship, and possibly a romantic relationship down the road.It may take time to get to the place where you're sharing feelings with a girl in your school, so be patient. You may have to spend some time socializing with her outside of school or at an after school club before the two of you feel close enough to open up to one another. Be patient and let things happen organically. You cannot force intimacy.As you get to know someone, you'll find you begin sharing things naturally as you feel more comfortable with one another. The girl may mention her family, share her opinion on a social issue, or tell you how she's feeling on a given day. Try to listen genuinely to what she says, and share your own emotions in turn.  Social media can be a great way to get to know someone, especially if you tend to be shy. Many people meet in real life, and then strengthen that existing bond on social media. Once you've gotten to know girls in your school a little, add them on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets. You can comment on a girl's Facebook post and talk to her through the messenger feature. Many people feel more relaxed talking online, and if you've established a bond online it may make face-to-face communication feel easier.Keep in mind, however, not to overdo it. If you pester a girl too much on social media, she may get annoyed. Do not, for example, like all her statuses, or comment on all her posts. Use discretion.  Asking questions is a great way to promote the flow of a conversation. They help the conversation move forward and show that you're genuinely interested in what the speaker has to say. When talking to girls in your school, ask a lot of questions to get to know them better.Ask general questions to start a conversation. For example, you can ask something like, ""How was your day?"" or ""How did you do on that last test?""As the conversation continues, ask questions about the topic at hand. For example, if the girl mentions her family is getting a new puppy, don't just say, ""Oh, that's cool."" Instead, ask about this. Say something like, ""What breed? Are you getting him from the shelter or a breeder?"", After you've talked to a girl a bit, and know her somewhat, try inviting her to hang out. You can invite her to hang out in a group with you and your friends. However, you can also ask her to hang out with you one-on-one.If you want to go on a date, ask the girl to go somewhere with just you that feels date-like. You could ask her to go see a movie, to get dinner, or to grab coffee.You can also invite a girl to a social outing with your friends. This can be a great way to get to know a girl as a friend. You can also expand your friend's group by introducing a new member.  It can be hard to get to know people if you're shy. If social situations make you nervous, there are ways you can overcome shyness. It may sound strange, but rehearsing what you want to say ahead of time may actually help.If you have to talk to a girl on the phone, or you know you'll see her in class, try writing down what you want to say. Obviously, you cannot plan out a whole conversation, but try jotting down what you want to talk about.Try to rehearse these words out loud, in front of a mirror. When you end up talking to the girl, the conversation may not play out exactly as you planned. However, you may be less nervous as you have some kind of a plan.  It can also help to write down conversation starters. If you're going on a date, or getting together with the girl socially, conversation starters can be particularly helpful. Jot down things you could use to start conversations, such as observations (""I can't believe it's still snowing in March!), complements (""That's a great jacket on you!""), and questions (""Do you know what time the assembly is today?""). It may sound silly, but many people choke in the moment and fail to start a conversation. Having a plan can help.  For many, shyness can be very difficult to overcome. It can help to talk out your issues with shyness with friends and family members. They may offer support, advice, and insight on how to cope with shyness.Choose people you feel will listen without judgment. Put-downs and lectures are unlikely to be helpful, so don't talk to people who like to give unsolicited advice. Select people who will listen and try to understand without trying to dismiss your shyness.  Talking to girls in your school can be very intimidating. Many high school students are shy around girls. It may help to practice socializing in other places. Make conversation with boys in your class, make small talk with a clerk at the drugstore, call a family member who lives far away. Practice socializing in situations where you're less likely to feel nervous. This can help you relax more when talking to a girl.","['If you want to make contact with a girl you like, first try and relax your body.', ""You want to make sure you don't communicate nervousness or

Share with her your opinions on whatever it is she cares about.Getting into a serious conversation about your interests is good, and should create an impression.  Add her on Facebook and Twitter after you've already had a conversation about something. Now she'll be faced, at home, with the thought of you. Like one of her recent status' or a profile picture to show that you've took time to look at her page.  Start to hang out with her outside of school or college. Invite her and her friends to join you and your friends. Make it a group oriented affair at first. Don't ask her to hang out alone or she may feel uncomfortable.

This can seem like a counter productive technique, but you're simply trying to add more attention to yourself.  Just don't make it obvious! Eye contact is a powerful agent in attraction. When appropriate try to touch her shoulder in order to get her attention. She could become very uncomfortable by this. Gauge her response and don't over do it.

Let her know that she doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to do.Tell her that you still want to be friends no matter what she decides. Even if she isn't ready to be with you now, she could come around if you're available.  If all her friends start acting cold towards you, you're probably not welcome to hang out anymore.

Other people can become creeped out by this, especially if they're in a committed relationship.  Going for a girl who is ""taken"" can be controversial, but if you think she might like you, too, it's OK to try.

Did she give you reason to think she's romantically interested? If so, as they say, ""all's fair in love and war.""However, make sure you aren't interpreting friendliness as romantic interest. Just because she's nice to you doesn't mean she wants to break up with her boyfriend for you.You should also consider your relationship with her boyfriend. If you're friends with him, you might want to consider his girlfriend off-limits, out of respect.  Maybe she's not in an exclusive relationship with her boyfriend. Lots of people date more than one person at once, so this could be an option she's open to. It's still good to make sure she's interested in you, though, before you go too far. Even if she's open to dating around, she may not see you that way.  Girls don't particularly like to be asked out after they've turned someone down - especially if they already have a boyfriend. Even flirting constantly could annoy her. If she seems happy with her boyfriend, let her stay that way. The best you can hope for is becoming her friend.","['Weigh your options and decide if you really want to pursue this girl.', 'Going after a girl with a boyfriend is frowned upon, but it happens.',

Take it slow. Gaze into her eyes. Mirror her body position. Smile at her. Watch for signs of interest. Know when to move on.,How to Get an Uninterested Girl to Fall for You3,"When you are first getting to know a girl, it is important to avoid sharing too much about yourself too soon. Sharing too much about yourself too soon can be overwhelming for a girl and also makes you seem less mysterious. Keep some of the mystery alive by withholding certain details until you get to know each other better.For example, you should avoid discussing topics like your ex, family conflicts, or your personal finances. Instead, focus on questions that help you get to know her better. Ask her about her likes and dislikes, her friends and family, her interests, etc.  Research has shown that prolonged eye contact can increase feelings of attraction between two people.If you are trying to win her over, try looking into her eyes with a penetrating gaze. Just keep in mind that she may break the gaze if she is not interested. If she is interested, she will most likely give you some encouraging looks and smiles, even if she takes her eyes away from yours now and then.If a long gaze does not seem appropriate yet or you are just too nervous to hold a long gaze, try giving her frequent, quick glances.  Mirroring her body position can show a girl that you are interested and provide opportunities for her to do the same. You might already be doing this without noticing it. But if not, make a conscious effort to start mirroring her body position. For example, if a girl is leaning in towards you with one arm on the table, you can lean in with the opposite arm so that you look like a mirror image of her.  Smiling is an easy way to show a girl that you are interested in her and give her a chance to give you a smile in return. Smiling may also make you seem more attractive to the girl, which may work in your favor as well.Try to keep your smile as natural and relaxed as possible. Don’t force it or smile in a way that is unusual for you.  As you flirt and do other things to impress a girl, watch for signs that she is interested in you. If she is smiling, making eye contact, and mirroring your body position, then this might be a good sign. Other positive signs include touching her hair, adjusting her clothes, raising and lowering her eyebrows, or giving you a casual touch on the arm.  Sometimes two people are just not meant to be together. If a girl does not show interest after you have done your best to get her attention, move on.

To really get to know her, ask to join her for a class, excursion, or event to experience her favorite hobby firsthand.For instance, ask if you can join her for a bike ride or yoga class.  A person’s favorite music is closely linked to their personality, so knowing what she listens to may give you more insight into who she is. Ask her who her favorite bands or artists are, or look for any preferences she might have listed on her social media accounts. Use a digital streaming service to preview or download songs or albums that she likes and listen to them, on your own, or with her.

If it's the latter, try to strike up a conversation! The best way to start a conversation is to find common interests. If this girl is emo, then you can almost guarantee that her interests will be music related, like listening to, writing or composing lyrics, maybe even art related pass-times.It's even better if she has band merchandises on or has lyrics written over her stuffs. Find out what bands she likes and talk to her about them. Ask about her favorite bands or those bands members, how they look, act, or sound and what she thinks on the topics. , You might be able to suggest them to her. These can include anything from hardcore, post-hardcore, metal, metalcore, heavy metal, emo, punk rock, pop rock or even alternative.  Don't pretend to know things just because she's interested in them. , Be yourself and talk as yourself but remain quiet and try to be personal.  Don't make inappropriate gestures or try ridiculous schemes to gain her attention. Don't try to impress her with skills you do or don't posses, but instead try to be a friendly, warm person who she can relate to.  That means talking with her and also becoming friends with her friends and trying to be accepted into their friendship group. Try to talk to her about everything, not just music or school. Show her that her opinion matters and that you understand where she is coming from.However, if she tells you to stop talking to her, respect her wishes. ,Go to a concert of a band you both like. It is a great experience that you can treasure but may be slightly expensive.Local Shows- Seeing a small band in your town is an even better idea because you can be close whilst still being around others. This experience is much more special and you can find other like-minded people at these events while helping home grown talent.Going To A Small CD Store- Not many of these exist anymore, so if you do have one near you utilize it! They are great places to get music advice from other people whilst being in a beautifully quaint location that is probably relatively unknown.

Look her in the eye to get her attention. Smile to let her know you're interested. Practice good hygiene to make a good impression. Dress well to impress her. Be confident around her. Write her a sweet note or letter. Get her to talk to you first. Ask her questions to get to know her. Find what you have in common with her. Show her your intelligence and wit. Listen to her and be polite. Avoid teasing her. Participate in some of her activities. Sit next to her at lunch. Get to know her friends. Stand or sit near her. Beware of harassing a girl.,How to Get a Sixth Grade Girl to Notice You,"Catch the eye of the girl you like, whether you’re in class or at a social gathering outside of school. Try to hold her gaze for as long as possible, and remember to smile while doing so!If you’re shy or nervous and find it difficult to hold eye contact, try just catching her eye for a short period of time before looking away. Or, look at the center of her forehead or nose for the same effect if that’s easier.Avoid getting caught looking too much and getting distracted in class by making eye contact just a couple times per class period. , Try to smile at the girl you like as much as possible, whether you’re passing her by in the hall, catch her attention in class, or you get to talk to her. Let her know you’re friendly and interested in interacting her with just a simple smile whenever you look at her.Smiles are contagious! Chances are that she’ll smile back at you if you smile first, so you’ve got nothing to lose!, Be clean and fresh whenever you get to see or talk to her. Shower frequently to wash your body and hair, brush your teeth, use mouthwash, and put on deodorant.If you choose to wear cologne or a highly scented deodorant or body spray, note that less is more. You don’t want the girl you like to notice you because she’s revolted by an overwhelming smell of cologne.  Choose clean clothes without a lot of wrinkles to wear to school or other places where you’ll see the girl you like. You don’t need to be extra stylish, just wear something comfortable that’s not stained or torn and fits you well.You might not know her well yet, but if you know she likes a certain band, book, or movie, try wearing a t-shirt that features it. She might even strike up a conversation with you about it!, Before you even work up the courage to talk to the girl you like, you can project confidence in yourself that she will take notice of. Have good posture, with your head held held high and your shoulders back, make eye contact with people, and engage in what’s going on around you.Confidence is very different from arrogance. Be confident by knowing that you are successful and a pleasant person to be around without acting like you are the best in the universe.To help you feel confident on the inside, which will show on the outside, make an effort to accept compliments when people give them to you. Instead of brushing off your friend’s compliment of your shoes or shirt by saying, “Yeah, whatever, man,” just say, “Thanks, dude.” Also try making a list every day of five things, large or small, that you did well.  If you’re not quite ready to talk to her but still want her to notice you, try slipping a sweet or funny note into her locker, a school book, or someplace else she will find it.You can leave your note or letter anonymous by signing it with a code name or word and tell her she has to figure out who it is through clues you give her in each letter.Stick with a simple joke or compliment in your letters if you don’t want to be too forward with your feelings right away.  Observe her to see what kinds of books she reads, music she listens to, or teams she follows. Try picking up a book by the same author or wearing a t-shirt with the band or team she likes when you’re around her, and she might just strike up a conversation about it.Even if she doesn’t start talking to you, she will likely notice if you’re wearing, reading, or looking at something she’s interested in, too. Smile if she looks over at you, or even say “Hey, how’s it going?” to start up a conversation.There’s no need to snoop or be overly observant to find out the things she likes. Just pay attention when you see her wearing, reading, or talking about something excitedly. Chances are you already like some of the same things, or would want to learn more about them.  Start up a conversation more easily by having a question in mind to ask her. You can start with “Hey, how are you?” or “Hey, how’s it going?” but you can also be more specific with something like, “Hey, did you catch what the homework was for English? I missed it,” or, “Hey, did I see you at last week’s basketball game?”Don’t be disappointed if your question doesn’t lead to much of a conversation or if you blank out on what to say after the question you had in mind. Just smile and thank her for talking to you before walking away. She’ll remember that you were nice and went out of your way to talk to her.  If you strike up a conversation with her, ask her questions about her family, hobbies, school, movies, books, or sports and you are bound to find some things in common. Say, “I really like art too!” or “I have a big family as well; three older sisters and one younger brother.” She’ll remember these things, and take more notice of you in the future.You can use subjects you find in common with her to strike up future conversations. For example, if you’re both into learning about bugs and insects, you could bring a book you found on the subject to school and tell her, “Hey, look, I found this book with really cool pictures of beetles. I thought you’d like since we had that conversation about how we both like bugs.”Remember to be honest and tell her true things about yourself. Avoid the temptation to tell small lies or say you like something just because she likes it. The truth will only come out and make you look bad later if she continues to talk to you and get to know you better.  Let the girl know that you’re smart and funny by sharing fun facts, participating with answers in class, and telling jokes. Share the things you’re knowledgeable about with her and tell her a new joke when you talk to her.Never downplay your intelligence or “play dumb” to get the attention of the girl you like or to seem cooler around your friends.Avoid boasting about the things you know or trying too hard with silly jokes. Just make funny observations, engage in school, and don’t pretend to know a lot about something unless you really do!, Give her your full attention and listen carefully when she talks to you to show her that you really care what she has to say. Use polite language like “please” and “thank you” when you’re asking her a question, and wish her a good night or weekend when you’re parting ways.Kindness and respect can really make you stand out if other people she knows just try to tease her or end up being mean to get her attention. Everyone likes to be listened to and respected, and being mean is an immature way to get noticed.Remember things she says that you can bring up in later conversations. If she talks about a TV show she likes, you can start another conversation the next week saying, “Hey, did you see that there was a marathon of that show you like on TV yesterday?”, Show you are more mature than other boys by not engaging in some of the things you might see other boys doing, like teasing or taunting girls to get their attention. Know that girls mature sooner than boys, so even if you’re in sixth grade too, a sixth grade girl may be going through changes that you don’t know about yet.Never tease a girl about her body or call her bad names that you hear on TV or from other boys. The girl will not respond well or like you at all if you do these things. Instead, use respectful and polite language with her, and give her compliments on aspects of her personality, like her sense of humor or her taste in music, rather than on her appearance.If you talk to her about how you like her or ask to go on a date or start a relationship and she says no, don’t get upset or mad. Respect her feelings and don’t bug her about it. Understand that she may not be ready for a relationship yet, could have mixed feelings about you, or just not have those feelings at all.Be friends with the girl if she’s not interested in dating or anything else with you.  Join a club, sport, or other extracurricular activity that she does to spend more time around her and get to know her better. Talk to her about the club or sport, and even ask her for tips if you’re new and just learning about what you’re doing.Avoid joining in on everything that the girl is a part of, as she might become suspicious or annoyed that you’re suddenly everywhere she goes. Instead, choose some of her activities that you are genuinely interested in getting involved with and learning more about.  Join her at a table at lunch, sit next to her in a class, or another occasion during or after school. You don’t need to sit right next to her at lunch, just at the same table and close enough that you can start a conversation and make eye contact with her.Start with a simple “Hey, can I sit here?” Then you can move on to other easy topics, like school subjects or a school dance coming up. Don’t be afraid to talk to everyone else at the table, too, and not just her.  Talk to her friends individually or when they’re in a group and get to know them by being kind, asking questions, and finding things in common, just like you do with her. Learn more about her through them, and she will notice and feel comfortable around you when you’re friendly with all of her friends, too.Don’t worry about trying to get her alone and away from her friends if you always see her with them. It might be hard to talk to her with others around, but if you talk to everyone in the group, not just her, it will be a lot easier to feel comfortable with them and get chances later to catch her one-on-one.  When you’re in a group or sitting together, stand or sit near her so you can be ready to start a conversation. Don’t violate her personal space or boundaries, or touch her without permission, but you can let her know you’re there with a wave or come up closer to talk to her.If you don’t want to get too close to her, you can still subtly mimic her body language to send a signal that you’re paying attention to her. If she crosses her arms, leans her head on her hand, or stands with her hands in her pockets while she’s talking to you, wait at least 20 seconds and do the same or something similar.  Don’t engage in teasing or taunting behavior that you might see other boys doing to get a girl’s attention; she will not like you or be interested in you at all. Never touch her or her stuff without asking first, tease her with names, or say anything about her body. Treat her with respect and be kind to her if you want her attention.You can get suspended or expelled from school or get into other major trouble for touching or harassing a girl, so don’t do it. Even calling her names or teasing her when you’re chatting on the computer or texting is wrong, could get you in trouble, and should never be done.Don’t follow what you learn on TV or movies, from video games, or other boys your age or older if they talk about calling girls certain names or making any comments about how a girl’s body has changed or how it looks. Call a girl by her own name or what she prefers to be called, and say nice things to her, preferably about her personality rather than how she looks.Be friends with a girl if she’s not interested in dating or anything else with you. Also listen to what she says and leave her alone entirely if she asks you to.","['Catch the eye of the girl you like, whether you’re in class or at a social gathering outside of school.', 'Try to hold

Determine if it is worth the risk. Figure out if she is interested. Get to know the sister. Ask her out. Go on a few dates. Be sensitive to your friend’s feelings.,How to Deal With Having a Crush on Your Friend's Sister3,"Consider the possibility that a romantic relationship between you and the sister could have repercussions on your relationship with your friend.Family loyalty runs deep, and you may find yourself running into problems with both siblings.If you and the sister break up, your friend may take her side and be angry with you.The sister may not want to pursue a relationship with you if she sees how upsetting it is to her sibling.  Observe her behavior and determine if you think she might like you. Because of the potential of damaging your friendship, you might not want to pursue her unless you know you have a good chance of being successful.For example, maybe she is talking to you a lot, making eye contact and smiling. Those could be signs she is interested in you.  If the only thing you know about her is that she’s cute and is related to your friend, spend some time learning more about her. Her personality may make her more or less attractive to you.Talk to her while at your friend’s house. Ask her about her interests and favorite things. Find out what you have in common besides your friend.For example, you could ask “Are you going out for the swim team again next year? Which events did you do this year?” or “I heard you have Mr. Winters for geometry. How are you doing in that class? It was impossible for me.”Try to get to know her without your friend present, but do not try to ditch your friend to do this. Wait until your friend leaves the room, for example.You may find out that while you enjoy hanging out with the sister in your friend’s presence, you may find that the dynamic changes when you and the sister are alone.

But we’ve been hanging out so much together this summer, and I’ve gotten to know you better and enjoy your company. So I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometime.”Let her know that you have talked to her sibling about it. You could say, “I told Tina how I feel and she is okay with me asking you out. We talked about it for a long time. I didn’t want to cause any problems in your family.”If she doesn’t seem interested, let it go and move on. It is not worth pursuing her to risk your relationship with your friend.  See how it is hanging out with just the sister. See if you have any romantic connection, or if she is just someone you care about as a friend or “like a sister.”If she seems to like you, too, take things very slowly. Do not rush the relationship. You do not want to move too fast and cause hurt feelings that could damage your relationship with your friend.If it doesn’t seem like you have a connection beyond just a friendship, stop dating her. Don’t force the relationship to happen. It could complicate your relationship with your friend and their family.For example, you could say, “I really like you, but I think we are better as friends.

Become familiar to her. Talk to her. Find out what she is interested in. Try to establish a friendship. Give her sincere compliments. Be nice to her friends. Act relaxed and confident when you are around her. Make small romantic moves.,How to Get a Girl to Notice You1,"Girls are more likely to talk to a guy if they are not complete strangers. Catch her eye in class and smile, nod at her in the school hallways, or make an effort to sit near her at lunch. Of course, don’t follow her around (that might creep her out) but simply making sure she knows your face will make her more receptive to talking to you at some point.Little things like asking her the date or hanging out at the same after-school spot will make her begin to start noticing you. , While this might seem obvious, lots of guys struggle with the idea of approaching the girl they like. However, you’re just going to have to go for it. Walk up to her before class and strike up a conversation, talk to her in the lunch line, or say hey to her at a party. Make a passing joke about your teacher’s silly tie in math class or ask her what she did this weekend while waiting in line for lunch.Be observant. What does she like to do? Are there any clues that can give you an idea of what she likes? Maybe she is constantly doodling in class, or carrying a soccer ball around. This little things you observe about her can help you to come up with ideas for what to talk to her about.  To do this, you’ll have to be bold. Once you’ve talked to her a bit, you should start asking her questions about herself. What does she like to do? What movies is she into? What’s her favorite sport, art or food? The possibilities are endless, but the answers will help you to form a friendship. However, keep in mind that you shouldn’t just pummel her with questions (that may be sort of weird) but ask a question and let the conversation develop naturally.  Once you guys have talked and she knows who you are, consider asking her to hang out. Start by asking her to do something in a group and tell her to bring her friends along (this will make her more inclined to say yes). Ask her to come to the movies with your friends, play a pickup soccer game, go on a hike, go to a concert, etc. When you guys hang out, be attentive to her but not clingy--just act like you would with anyone else in your friend group.  Everyone likes to complimented now and then--make her day and give her a compliment that you really mean. Its important to say something that you really believe--fake compliments can sound stiff and are easily spotted. If you like her dress, tell her her dress is really cute. If she just played a song for you on the guitar and it was great--tell her that!, No matter what, you should always treat girls with respect--regardless of whether or not they are the one you are interested in. It helps to be extra nice to her friends. If they see you as the caring, sweet, funny guy you are, chances are they will tell the girl you like. However, don’t hang out with her friends (or just one of her friends) all the time--it might give her the idea that you are romantically interested in one of her friends.  Even if your heart lurches weirdly into your mouth, or you start sweating, act as relaxed as you can when hanging out with her, particularly if you don’t want to make a romantic move just yet (or clue her in to the fact that you want something more than friendship). Girls like a confident guy, not someone who becomes a hot mess whenever they approach him. Part of acting relaxed is reminding yourself that you’re a really cool and nice dude--any girl would be lucky to have such a great guy interested in her.Smile like you mean it. A sincere smile is a very attractive thing. If she makes a joke, allow yourself to laugh. When you look at her, or wave bye when walking to class, smile genuinely.Make eye contact. Look your girl in the eye when you guys are talking. Eye contact is a sign of confidence. If you look anywhere but at her face, she might think you are uninterested in her or that you have better things to do besides hang out with her.  Once you have established a friendship and you know that you want to make it something more, start making some romantic gestures that will clue her into the fact that you like her. Remember important dates like her birthday (and do something nice for her on that day), walk her to her next class (and then sprint to yours), or ask her to a dance.When you feel confident enough to do so, ask the girl you like out.","['Girls are more likely to talk to a guy if they are not complete strangers.', 'Catch her eye in class and smile, nod at her in the school hallways, or make an effort to sit near her at lunch.', 'Of course, don’t follow her around (that might creep her out) but simply making sure she knows your face will make her more receptive to talking to you at some point.', 'Little things like asking her the date or hanging out at the same after-school spot will make her begin to start noticing you.', ', While this might seem obvious, lots of guys struggle with the idea of approaching the girl they like.', 'However, you’re just going to have to go for it.', 'Walk up to her before class and strike up a conversation, talk to her in the lunch line, or say hey to her at a party.', 'Make a passing joke about your teacher’s silly tie in math class or ask her what she did this weekend while waiting in line for lunch.', 'Be observant.', 'What does she like to do?', 'Are there any clues that can give you an idea of what she likes?', 'Maybe she is constantly doodling in class, or carrying a soccer ball around.', 'This little things you observe about her can help you to come up with ideas for what to talk to her about.', 'To do this, you’ll have to be bold.', 'Once you’ve talked to her a bit, you should start asking her questions about herself.', 'What does she like to do?', 'What movies is she into?', 'What’s her favorite sport, art or food?', 'The possibilities are endless, but the answers will help you to form a friendship.', 'However, keep in mind that you shouldn’t just pummel her with questions (that may be sort of weird) but ask a question and let the conversation develop naturally.', 'Once you guys have talked and she knows who you are, consider asking her to hang out.', 'Start by asking her to do something in a group and tell her to bring her friends along (this will make her more inclined to say yes).', 'Ask her to come to the movies with your friends, play a pickup soccer game, go on a hike, go to a concert, etc.', 'When you guys hang out, be attentive to her but not clingy--just act like you would with anyone else in your friend group.', 'Everyone likes to complimented now and then--make her day and give her a compliment that you really mean.', 'Its important to say something that you really believe--fake compliments can sound stiff and are easily spotted.', 'If you like her dress, tell her her dress is really cute.', 'If she just played a song for you on the guitar and it was great--tell her that!,', 'No matter what, you should always treat girls with respect--regardless of whether or not they are the one you are interested in.', 'It helps to be extra nice to her friends.', 'If they see you as the caring, sweet, funny guy you are, chances are they will tell the girl you like.', 'However, don’t hang out with her friends (or just one of her friends) all the time--it might give her the idea that you are romantically interested in one of her friends.', 'Even if your heart lurches weirdly into your mouth, or you start sweating, act as relaxed as you can when hanging out with her, particularly if you don’t want to make a romantic move just yet (or clue her in to the fact that you want something more than friendship).', 'Girls like a confident guy, not someone who becomes a hot mess whenever they approach him.', 'Part of acting relaxed is reminding yourself that you’re a really cool and nice dude--any girl would be lucky to have such a great guy interested in her.', 'Smile like you mean it.', 'A sincere smile is a very attractive thing.', 'If she makes a joke, allow yourself to laugh.', 'When you look at her, or wave bye when walking to class, smile genuinely.', 'Make eye contact.', 'Look your girl in the eye when you guys are talking.', 'Eye contact is a sign of confidence.', 'If you look anywhere but at her face, she might think you are uninterested in her or that you have better things to do besides hang out with her.', 'Once you have established a friendship and you know that you want to make it something more, start making some romantic gestures that will clue her into the fact that you like her.', 'Remember important dates like her birthday (and do something nice for her on that day), walk her to her next class (and then sprint to yours), or ask her to a dance.', 'When you feel confident enough to do so, ask the girl you like out.']"
Show her you have a sense of humor. Be confident in yourself. Be attentive. Display good manners. Show passion for the things you are interested in. Let her know that you have emotional depth.,How to Get a Girl to Notice You2,"Everyone loves to laugh. Humor is a great way to get (and keep) a girl’s attention, so long as it is the right sort of humor. While this might not apply to some girls, most girls are generally a little turned off by crude or mean humor. Of course, being funny doesn’t mean that you need to transform yourself into the next Chris Pratt, but throwing some humor into a conversation can definitely catch a girl’s attention. If you’re not a natural-born comedian, here are some tips on creating your style of humor:Don’t wait for the girl to laugh. Quick, witty humor that seems unassuming is a good way to go--if she thinks you’re funny, she’ll laugh. However, never draw attention to the fact if she doesn’t laugh--that will just make the situation awkward, and you a little desperate. (Example: Don’t say something like “Oh so you didn’t think that was funny?”)Find some inspiration in famous comedians. If you feel like you need a little help getting into the comedic mood, watch comedians on TV or pay attention to the funny characters in movies. Watch how they deliver their jokes, but don’t memorize their jokes and simply repeat them (that could come across as rather stiff).Use situational humors. While dishing out witty one-liners can make a girl laugh, try commenting on your situation or environment in a funny way.Don’t pick on the girl you’re interested in. While teasing may be funny at first, don’t rely on it as your only source of humor because that can definitely get old. If you find that teasing is something you’re pretty good at--tease yourself. Self-deprecating humor can be funny and will show the girl that you are confident enough in yourself that you can make fun of your own flaws.  Confidence is a very attractive quality. Feel good about yourself because you are an awesome dude--your inner confidence will shine through and your girl will notice. Walk with your head held high, volunteer interesting information, and don’t hesitate when walking up to the girl you like--just do it. Having confidence also means laughing at yourself and not getting in a huff when the girl you like has other plans or talks to another guy.Being confident does not mean that you should act cocky. There is a fine line between being confident and being a self-involved jerk. When you are confident, you have faith in your abilities without holding that over others. When you’re cocky, you brag about how awesome you are. Avoid the latter. Girls are attractive to guys who are confident without telling everyone around them how great they are, constantly.  When you are talking to the girl you like, give her your undivided attention. Listen carefully to what she has to say--you may learn something you didn’t know about her, or find that you both have mutual interests, dreams, or ideas.Ask her about herself. Not only will this show that you care, it will also give you information you can use to woo her later.

Groom yourself. Put a little effort into how you dress. Consider your body language. Stay in shape.,How to Get a Girl to Notice You3,"If you do nothing else, remember this--you should shower regularly and brush your teeth. No girl is going to want to cozy up to a guy who has stuff in his teeth and smells like B.O. Bust out that great-smelling body wash (and deodorant) and start thinking of your toothbrush as your best friend. Of course, there are plenty of other things you can do to get her attention with your well-groomed looks.Going beyond the basics: Find a cologne that will make girls swoon, wash your face so that your skin is blemish free, add a little bit of styling gel to your hair to get that ‘I just got out of bed but I’m so manly that I just look this good all the time’ look--the possibilities are endless. If its going to make you smell good, look good, and feel good, it’s probably something you should try.Considering body hair: Clip that nose hair and pluck that unibrow! If you’re rocking some facial hair, props to you. Just make sure to keep it in check--its generally better to have no beard than a flowing, ‘I’ve just been asleep for 100 years’ Rip Van Winkle look.Clipping your nails: Do it. You don’t want to be thinking about holding her hand, only to cut her with your talons when you make a move. While you’re at it, scrape that dirt out from under there.  This doesn’t mean going out and buying a whole new wardrobe, but you should definitely give your wardrobe some consideration. Ditch any articles of clothing that are stained or torn. Everyone has their own style--but ‘slob’ style is definitely the least attractive. Don’t wear the same shirt every day of the week, and try to put a bit more effort into your outfit instead of just throwing on a sweatshirt and sweatpants.Play up your style. Whether you are a hipster, jock, or have some style all your own, put a little effort into what you wear in the morning.  Believe it or not, your posture actually plays a big part in how girls perceive you. If you have a tendency to hunch, avoid eye contact and play with your hands, a girl is going to be less inclined to come over and strike up a conversation. Stand up straight, keep your eyes up, and get a smile going--you will look much more approachable.Keep in mind that while you really should have good posture, you should also carry yourself with ease. Standing up straight does not mean walking around like a robot or holding yourself so rigidly that you look like Frankenstein. If you don’t know how to carry yourself with ease, draw inspiration from movies or TV. Watch how the lead guy holds himself (and eventually charms his way into the lead girl’s heart).  While this does not mean that you have to lift for your life, you should keep in mind that if you want to get that drop dead gorgeous girl to notice you, you’re going to have to keep your physique in mind. She puts effort into her looks, so you should too. Start an exercise routine that combines both cardio and weight-training for an all around toned look.Keep in mind that most girls like a guy who looks fit, but not one that has muscles that are about to rip through his t-shirt every time he raises his arm in class. If your goal is to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was Mr. Universe, you may want to tone it back a bit.","['If you do nothing else, remember this--you should shower regularly and brush your teeth.', 'No girl is going to want to cozy up to a guy who has stuff in his teeth and smells like B.O.

Become physically fit. Dress to attract. Maintain your personal hygiene. Uphold good posture. Eat well.,How to Be Attractive to Girls1,"Many people think that you have to lift weights to get fit. This is not the case. You can do a full work out without a gym membership. Push-ups work your chest and triceps massively while crunches work your abs. You also want to try step out of the house for your cardio by biking, running, or swimming.Do sit ups by putting your calf/feet on the seat of a chair, with your back on the ground. Then put your hands on the back of your head and move your head towards the ceiling.Exercising not only tones your body to promote your attractiveness, it also gives you more energy and confidence. , Dressing your age tells a lot about your personality. It is proven that a guy who dresses like he is 16 isn’t as attractive as a guy wearing a mature look. You don't have to wear a sport coat but a simple upgrade to your style will help. Invest in chinos and nicer jeans instead of continuing to wear old worn out denim. Go for slim cuts in both your top and bottom. Try out several colors and pick the ones that accent your attributes (hair, skin, and eye color) the most.Look after your shoes. Discard your sneakers after they start to rip or loss their thread. Care for your leather shoes by treating them twice a year.Also a good thing to take into account is the feel of your clothes. When you break the touch barrier, girls like things that feel nice and it's also important that you feel physically comfortable in them.One technique to attract someone is by wearing an eye-catching outfit.Scientifically, women are more inclined to be attracted to a man wearing red.

Take a shower everyday and use shampoo and soap products that compliment your body. Find a deodorant that smells good with a pinch of musk. Consider a touch of cologne for those special dates, but never use more than two squirts. Brush your teeth regularly, at least twice a day, and use other dental hygiene-related items like floss and mouthwash.Consider using lotion for the colder months so your skin stays moist and healthy to the touch.

Straightening your posture will make you look taller, stronger, and more confident.Imagine your upper torso is molded on a coat hanger.  Eating well not only helps with your body image, but it helps yourself in several ways. Improving your diet can increase your energy, confidence, and your general well-being.

Don’t be bashful and try your luck at something. There is nothing to lose unless you get into extreme sports.  Just relax when you’re talking to a girl.

You can approach someone without opening yourself up to being evaluated. Eventually, you'll be confident enough to talk to them in a normal conversation. Try some of these cues:Ask a small favor like “can you watch my stuff while I get coffee?” This creates attraction from the person doing the favor.Ask a question. Use whatever situation/location you are in to your advantage. Ask a relevant question like “have you seen this band before?” or “you think Texas could be a country?” Be whimsical if you are feeling it.  A great way to prove yourself to a woman is showing her that you not only respect her, but all women. It is too common for guys to view picking up girls as a macho competition instead of wanting to get to know a woman. You can show respect by listening to what she has to say, respecting her personal space, making sure not to interrupt her, and refraining from making statements like “you wouldn’t want to do that, it’s a guy thing.”Never make fun of a girl when you’re trying to tease them. A little bit of joking is okay, but avoid anything that could be taken as offensive by someone.Generosity also goes a long way. No one likes a guy who is too stingy to have a good time. The same can be said about someone who refuses to give a dollar from time to time.  Be a fun person by acting on spontaneity. It is attractive and more interesting to be around someone willing to go on an adventure. This can also show her how interesting you can be.Being silly and having fun also shows you’re confident and not afraid of taking risks.  Careful not to be a know-it-all or overly pretentious. Most girls will like a guy who reads from time to time and is interested in the world around him. Put down the video game and pick up a book. Try getting into the habit of reading the news every morning. You’ll have more to add to a conversation when you are on top of current events.Not every girl cares about this.  Making someone laugh is a great thing and it is attractive. It is one of the most desirable traits women look for in a man. Don’t modify your humor to appeal to someone in particular. Your natural humor will attract the type of person who you’ll be able to relax around.Laughter affects people on a chemical level. It increases the level of serotonin in our brains which causes our brain's function to work more efficiently.  This doesn't always have to do with your looks, but how you think of yourself. Have confidence that you'll achieve your goals. Change your mentality: if you think you're attractive you will be attractive. Thinking positively is the first step, but then to ‘’act’’ positively will increase your self esteem even more. This can be simple like talking to people in a positive manner and focus your energy into acting this way.Have ambitions for your life. When you have a serious drive for your life, women will take notice.Change one of your bad habits. Start small like waking up without hitting snooze two or three times or drinking 64 ounces of water a day. Start small and progressively work to improve yourself in larger ways.Do something you’ve been procrastinating. There is no time like the present. It can even be a small thing like cleaning your room.","['Women are attracted to men with a passion in their lives.', 'It is attractive to live outside the cookie cutter routine of eat, work, sleep, and repeat.', 'Pick up a hobby and plan to change your hobby into your passion.', 'Try your hand at a musical instrument, a craft like pottery, cooking, writing, running, rock-climbing, and more.', 'When you express a sincere passion she will respond positively.', 'Life is too short not be passionate about something.', 'Don’t be bashful and try your luck at something.', 'There is nothing to lose unless you get into extreme sports.', 'Just relax when you’re talking to a girl.', 'Women like it when a guy is direct; they are not mind readers.', 'Speaking to someone you don’t know can produce a lot of anxiety for some.', 'You can approach someone without opening yourself up to being evaluated.', ""Eventually, you'll be confident enough to talk to them in a normal conversation."", 'Try some of these cues:Ask a small favor like “can you watch my stuff while I get coffee?”', 'This creates attraction from the person doing the favor.', 'Ask a question.', 'Use whatever situation/location you are in to your advantage.', 'Ask a relevant question like “have you seen this band before?”', 'or “you think Texas could be a country?”', 'Be whimsical if you are feeling it.', 'A great way to prove yourself to a woman is showing her that you not only respect her, but all women.', 'It is too common for guys to view picking up girls as a macho competition instead of wanting to get to know a woman.', 'You can show respect by listening to what she has to say, respecting her personal space, making sure not to interrupt her, and refraining from making statements like “you wouldn’t want to do that, it’s a guy thing.', '”Never make fun of a girl when you’re trying to tease them.', 'A little bit of joking is okay, but avoid anything that could be taken as offensive by someone.', 'Generosity also goes a long way.', 'No one likes a guy who is too stingy to have a good time.', 'The same can be said about someone who refuses to give a dollar from time to time.', 'Be a fun person by acting on spontaneity.', 'It is attractive and more interesting to be around someone willing to go on an adventure.', 'This can also show her how interesting you can be.', 'Being silly and having fun also shows you’re confident and not afraid of taking risks.', 'Careful not to be a know-it-all or overly pretentious.', 'Most girls will like a guy who reads from time to time and is interested in the world around him.', 'Put down the video game and pick up a book.', 'Try getting into the habit of reading the news every morning.', 'You’ll have more to add to a conversation when you are on top of current events.', 'Not every girl cares about this.', 'Making someone laugh is a great thing and it is attractive.', 'It is one of the most desirable traits women look for in a man.', 'Don’t modify your humor to appeal to someone in particular.', 'Your natural humor will attract the type of person who you’ll be able to relax around.', 'Laughter affects people on a chemical level.', ""It increases the level of serotonin in our brains which causes our brain's function to work more efficiently."", ""This doesn't always have to do with your looks, but how you think of yourself."", ""Have confidence that you'll achieve your goals."", ""Change your mentality: if you think you're attractive you will be attractive."", 'Thinking positively is the first step, but then to ‘’act’’ positively will increase your self esteem even more.', 'This can be simple like talking to people in a positive manner and focus your energy into acting this way.', 'Have ambitions for your life.', 'When you have a serious drive for your life, women will take notice.', 'Change one of your bad habits.', 'Start small like waking up without hitting snooze two or three times or drinking 64 ounces of water a day.', 'Start small and progressively work to improve yourself in larger ways.', 'Do something you’ve been procrastinating.', 'There is no time like the present.', 'It can even be a small thing like cleaning your room.']"
Look for signals of flirting. Seek out someone in your league. Never shy from an opportunity.,How to Be Attractive to Girls3,"There are some universal signals that are used frequently.

This will not always happen candidly. Be on the lookout for eye contact and a smile.Don’t be afraid to make the initial flirt with someone.  Guys and girls are typically attracted to those who are in their league. When people date out of their league, relationships typically suffer because of jealousy or lack of interest.Take a moment to look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself how attractive am I? This could be hard for some and most people need help if they don’t understand what “league” they fall into. Your physical appearance doesn’t take into account everything.Your attractiveness also depends upon your personality (including your humor), your dance moves, your hobbies, your friends, your family life, and more.There are successful relationships where members of the couple are out of each other's league. Take this with a grain of salt and know that keeping this in mind will simply make things a little easier for you.In general if you feel a connection with someone, you probably have a shot. You are also probably in the same “league” if you feel some type of chemistry. Just go for it!, Never limit yourself to where you should try to attract someone. You never know when the magic spark will light up. There is still a chance even if you’re working late and on the subway at night. Never shy away from an opportunity to attract a woman.Flirting in an unusual place like a subway or waiting room shows confidence. You never know until you try it.Don’t come off as too strong. It is important to seize the moment, but do it in a way where the girl doesn’t feel uncomfortable.Employ active listening when talking to someone. This will give you more of an opportunity and show her you care.

Build up your self-confidence. Practice in the mirror. Find a way to run into her. Start with a compliment. Ask her for help. Figure out her interests. Join something she is a part of. Hang out in person. Be yourself. Communicate often. Pay attention. Remember the important details. Make her laugh. Drop hints that you like her as more than a friend. Look for signs that she likes you. Tell her how you feel.,How to Befriend a Girl You Like,"Talking to a girl you like can be a scary experience and requires a lot of bravery and belief in yourself. Before you go and talk to her, create a list of your best attributes. Once you read over your list, you'll discover that you have a lot to be confident about. If you stand up straight you’ll automatically feel more confident. Keep your arms uncrossed to signal with your body language that you are open and friendly.Remember to try and look your best. Put on an outfit that you feel comfortable in and makes you look good. , If you’re very nervous about talking to the girl you like, practice what you want to say in front of the mirror. Be careful not to practice too much or you may sound robotic when speaking to her in real life.  Look for the perfect opportunity to run into the girl you like. If you go to the same school, you could hang out where you know she has lunch or if you work at the same job, you could take your break at the same time she does.Be sure to pick a place that is casual and comfortable for both of you. For example, you wouldn’t want to run into her outside of her house if you’ve never been there as that may seem creepy and scare her.Pick a time to run into her when it’s a good time to talk. For example, if she is running late to an after school activity, waiting for her after class lets out would not be a good idea as she would be rushing to leave.Try to find a time when she won't be surrounded by a big group of friends. It can be hard to approach a girl if she is with a big group of people.  The easiest opening line is a genuine compliment. Your compliment should show that you pay attention and should be specific to the girl you like. A good compliment can easily lead into a conversation.For example, if the girl you like scored a goal at her last soccer game you could say, “Congratulations on that goal! You’re an awesome soccer player. How long have you been playing for?” This compliment shows that you noticed her soccer skills, paid attention to the last game and are interested in learning more about her.Avoid generic compliments like “You’re pretty” or “You’re nice” as these can sound insincere and impersonal.  A great way to start a conversation is to ask her for help on something she has expertise in. People like to feel useful and share their knowledge.For example, if you run into the girl you like at the library you could ask her for a book recommendation. If you both enjoy reading, this could lead to a great conversation on the latest things you’ve read or your favorite books.  Do a little detective work and discover some things your crush likes or dislikes. You may find you have some interests in common or at least something to talk about.To help figure out her interests, you can talk to some mutual friends to learn more about her. You can also check out her social media pages to see what sorts of things she likes to do.Most people love to talk about the things that they are interested in. Once you find out one of her interests you can ask her about it to learn more. For example, if you know she is interested in basketball, you can ask her how long she has been playing. This can also lead into the two of you going to play basketball together.  In order to spend more time with the girl you like, it is helpful to join something she is part of like an after school club, a team or a volunteer organization.For example, if the girl you like volunteers at a retirement home on the weekends, you could also sign up to volunteer at the retirement home. If she is part of the debate club at school and you’re interested in debate, you could join that club and spend more time with her there.  It may be tempting to hide behind a screen but you need to spend time with the girl you like in real life. Your relationship will develop when you have connections in the real world and not only over the phone or computer.  Don’t ever try to be someone you’re not. You want the girl you like to like you, not a persona you’ve invented.For example, if she is part of the school band but you don’t play an instrument, you shouldn’t join the band just to spend time with her. You could attend the band’s concerts to support her while finding another activity or interest you have in common.Remember to keep up your own interests as well. If you're spending time doing an activity that she likes, still make time to do activites that you like. Girls like when you have your own interests and hobbies.  Good communication is the key to any relationship, romantic or not. You should try and communicate everyday, whether in person, over the phone or through social media.Remember not to overdo it with your communication. If the girl you like is pulling back or cutting your conversations short, take a break from communicating. She may be busy or simply uninterested.  Make sure you are listening attentively when she talks. Keep comfortable eye contact and nod while she speaks so she knows you’re listening. Follow up with relevant questions to really show that you’re paying attention and care about what she has to say.  If she is sharing something with you, try to commit it to memory. This shows her that you care about what she is saying and that you're interested in her.For example, if she says, “My brother, Carson, really loves basketball. He has a game this weekend,” you should remember her brother’s name. That way, after the weekend, you can say something like, “Hey! How was your weekend? How did Carson do at his game?”, Girls love when people make them laugh. Embrace your natural sense of humor and ensure you are both having a good time whenever you hang out.You don’t have to be a stand-up comedian to make the girl you like laugh. You can share a funny story you’ve heard or a silly pun one of your friends came up with.If you’re shy or don’t think you’re funny, don’t force yourself to tell jokes. Focus on making the girl you like smile while you learn what sort of things make her laugh. For example, you could watch a comedy special together or go to an improv show and laugh together.  Drop small hints, like compliments or hanging out one on one, that show this girl you like her as more than just a friend.For example, if you notice she is wearing a new sweater you could say, “Wow, that sweater looks great on you. You look really beautiful today.” This type of compliment is sincere, shows you notice small details and sounds romantic, which may help her to see you in a romantic way.You could also ask her to hang out one on one. For example, you could suggest a study date by saying, “Do you want to go to a cafe and study for our Spanish test tonight? Just the two of us. I’ll treat you to a cup of hot chocolate.”A great hint that you like her is giving her a gift. You want to make sure the gift is a small and thoughtful token and not something expensive and impersonal. The gift should be something you bought because it made you think of her and shows that you care.  If the girl you like is interested in you as well, she may begin to drop some hints that she wants to be more than friends. Look for moments when she is acting flirty, touching you or making plans to spend alone time with you.She may also be dropping hints that she is not interested. If she invites other people to hang out with you or talks about other people she has feelings for, she may not be interested in anything more than friendship with you.Everyone has a slightly different way of showing that they’re interested. Just because she is showing lots of signs that she likes you doesn’t mean that she does for sure. And if she isn’t showing any signs, it doesn’t mean she’s not interested.  It’s important to be honest with the girl that you like as you’re building up your friendship. Be direct and tell her how you feel. If you think she might be feeling the same way, you could follow up by asking her on a date.For example, you could say, “I’ve enjoyed all this time we’ve been spending together lately and I really like you. Would you want to go out with me?” Make it obvious that you are inviting her on a romantic date because you have feelings for her and not just a hang out as friends.Give the girl you like time to answer. Whatever her answer, be respectful of her decision and accept how she feels.","['Talking to a girl you like can be a scary experience and requires a lot of bravery and belief in yourself.', 'Before

Be confident. Be assertive.Being assertive is really a part of being confident. Get some experience. Be mature.,How to Attract an Older Woman (Teens)1,"If you want to attract an older woman, then confidence is absolutely key. If you're a teen, then you're probably still figuring out who you are, who your friends are, what you want to do with your life, and how you fit in. That's all fine, but when you see or hang out with the older woman, this stuff shouldn't come to the forefront. Instead, you should show her the positive thoughts you have about yourself. Hey, you may still be figuring it out, but you love who you are, you love hanging out with other people, and you love having a good time.If she sees you noticing her, stand tall and proud.Show the woman that you're comfortable with yourself instead of trying to fit in all the time.You should speak clearly, make eye contact, and act like you know what you're talking about -- even if you don't.It's natural to have insecurities, and as you get to know the woman or older girl, you can bring those out, but you should come out strong out of the gate.Remember your competition -- older guys who are in college or who are maybe even starting their careers. If the woman sees that you're still struggling to find yourself, she'll move on. , Being assertive means that you're comfortable enough with yourself to know what you want, and to be okay with telling people what you want. Instead of being wishy- washy or unsure, you should be clear about your needs -- whether it's that you want to get to know her, you want to take her out, or that you have a great idea for a date. Though you should respect her age and wisdom, don't defer to her all the time just because she's older, or she'll start to think that you don't have much to contribute.Once you see the woman you like, let her see you notice her. Don't be shy about it. You can even smile at her, or approach her, if the timing is right.Don't cower in the corner. Just come up to her, even if it's only to say hi.If you want to be assertive, you have to say what you mean and mean what you say. Be clear, even if you're only introducing yourself.It's okay to get nervous, but try to minimize fidgeting, stumbling over your words, or looking at the floor because she's too beautiful.  It may be hard to get experience when you're only sixteen years old, but every little thing you do counts. This doesn't mean that you should try to hook up with as many girls as possible or to backpack across Europe to understand what life ""is really all about."" It does mean that you should do what you can to broaden your horizons, so the older woman will see that you have depth and that you have some things to teach her, too. If she constantly feels like she knows everything and has to ""train"" you to be an adult, then things will get old fast. Here are some ways to get some experience:Travel. Spend your summer or even your spring break traveling to a new place, whether it's to Costa Rica on a service trip or just to visit a relative a few states away. The more places you see and people you meet, the more you'll see that the world is bigger than your own backyard or hometown.Date. You shouldn't date girls just to get experience, but dating even a girl or two can help you understand how to deal with women, and can also help you get some experience when it comes to hooking up. An older woman will be less likely to date you if it's obvious that you've never even had another girlfriend, because that's a big burden for her to take on.Immerse yourself in a variety of activities. You may love baseball, but if baseball is the only thing you know and love, you may run out of things to talk about with the older woman pretty quickly. Spend your Sundays volunteering, join the French culture club or school paper, or just do a few things that can help you develop a passion about a variety of subjects.  Again, though it may be difficult to feel or act mature when you're a teenager, you'll have to do your best to impress the woman. Women already mature a bit faster than men, and the difference in your maturity levels may be more noticeable if you're a few years -- or more -- younger than the woman. You should work on controlling your moods, having reasonable reactions to disappointing or upsetting situations, and minimizing your vulgar language, fart jokes, and other loud noises that may go over well with your buddies on the football team.Part of being mature is being in control of your feelings. Let the woman see that you don't get easily angry or upset, or she'll think you're throwing a temper tantrum.Another part of being mature is to not complain about every little thing. If you complain about the minor things that irk you, the woman will think that you don't have the good sense to appreciate all of the wonderful things in your life.Avoid gossiping about your friends or other people the woman may know. She may love to gossip too, but try not to do it too much, especially at first, or she'll think that you're not mature enough to respect people who aren't in the room.Be polite to everyone you see. If you take her out, be polite to servers and anyone else you encounter. This is a big sign of maturity.","['If you want to attract an older woman, then confidence is absolutely key.', ""If you're a teen, then you're probably still figuring out who you are, who your

Keep things fun. Use your age to your advantage. Avoid topics that make you sound young. Be independent.,How to Attract an Older Woman (Teens)2,"You should work on developing the characteristics that would make you appeal to an older woman, but you shouldn't forget to keep things fun. There must be something she likes about hanging out with or even dating a younger guy -- one of those things could be that younger guys have less baggage than older guys, and less worries about their college classes, jobs, or whatever it is the guys in her age bracket normally worry about.There's a difference between being immature and goofing off. Every woman loves to goof off from time to time, so don't be afraid to show her the silly aspects of your personality.Make her laugh. If your sense of humor is one of your best features, don't hide it because you worry it'll make you look immature if you try to make her laugh. As long as you pick relatively tasteful jokes, you'll be fun.Keep it light. Though you want her to see that you have depth, you don't have to talk about the most serious thoughts you have late at night the second you meet her. Have a good time first -- the rest will come later.  Don't think of being younger as a hindrance -- instead, it should be something that appeals to the woman. Your boyish good looks, amazing dance moves, or goofy jokes can be exactly what the woman likes about you. Don't say, ""I know I'm only seventeen, but..."" Instead, act like you love being seventeen and that the world is your oyster.Maybe you haven't done that many things, but you can impress the woman by talking about all of the things you will do, and how excited you are about life.Impress her with your energy and enthusiasm. You may be a lot more energetic than guys her own age -- and that's a good thing.  Though you obviously can't -- or shouldn't -- hide your age, you should avoid topics that make her realize how young you really are. If she's a college student and you're only in high school, then you shouldn't talk too much about the Homecoming game, your tenth period math class, or about that time when you got detention for talking back to a teacher.You shouldn't hide high-school like aspects of your life, but you shouldn't emphasize them either. Talk about your family, friendships, or current events -- make her see you outside your high school bubble.If you're both in high school or college but you're a freshman and she's a senior, talk more about the things you want to do later in your coursework instead of what it's like to be brand-new at a school. It's likely that she's matured a lot between her freshman and senior year, and if she's constantly reminded that you're only a freshman, she'll see that you may have a lot of growing up to do.  An older woman will have more mature friendships, more varied and intense interests, and a more busy schedule. Though you may want nothing more than to spend as much time as possible with this woman, you need her to see that you have your own friends, your own schedule, and your own needs.If you start dating each other seriously, then you may start spending a lot of time together, but if you're just trying to attract her and get her attention, you can't be clingy or she'll be turned off.If she does hang out with you, don't say, ""When can I see you again?"" right away. Play it cool and ask her out a few days later.Talk about your schedule. Let her see that you have a lot going on too. If she thinks that all you do is sit at home and play video games and wait for her to call, she'll be less eager to hang out with you.","[""You should work on developing the characteristics that would make you appeal to an older woman, but you shouldn't forget to keep things fun."", 'There must be something she likes about hanging out with or even dating a younger guy -- one of those things could be that younger guys have less baggage than older guys, and less worries about their college classes, jobs, or whatever it is the guys in her age bracket normally worry about.', ""There's a difference between being immature and goofing off."", ""Every woman loves to goof off from time to time, so don't be afraid to show her the silly aspects of your personality."", 'Make her laugh.', ""If your sense of humor is one of your best features, don't hide it because you worry it'll make you look immature if you try to make her laugh."", ""As long as you pick relatively tasteful jokes, you'll be fun."", 'Keep it light.', ""Though you want her to see that you have depth, you don't have to talk about the most serious thoughts you have late at night the second you meet her."", 'Have a good time first -- the rest will come later.', ""Don't think of being younger as a hindrance -- instead, it should be something that appeals to the woman."", 'Your boyish good looks, amazing dance moves, or goofy jokes can be exactly what the woman likes about you.', 'Don\'t say, ""I know I\'m only seventeen, but...""

Be a gentleman. Show a real interest in her. Keep up a good conversation. Don't bring up your age difference all the time. Don't forget to be yourself.,How to Attract an Older Woman (Teens)3,"If you want to treat an older woman right, then you absolutely have to be a gentleman. This may be a foreign concept to you, but all it really means is that you should treat her like a lady and give her kindness and respect. If you pick her up in your car, hold the passenger door open for her, and hold the door open for her if you enter a restaurant or any other location. If she comes over, take her coat and hang it up. Here are some other ways to be a gentleman:Show up on time, or even a little early. Let her see that she means a lot to you.Always complement her. Tell her she looks stunning, beautiful, or however she may look that day. Don't be embarrassed to tell her what you really think -- this will win her over as long as you do it in moderation.Don't spit, scratch yourself, burp, or do other un-gentlemanly things.Always look nice. Make an effort to shower, groom yourself, and to wear unwrinkled and well-fitting clothing. This will show her that you've put thought and effort into seeing her.Take her out on nice dates. Don't take her to the local Burger King. You may not have a lot of spending money, but you should make an effort to do something that is at least romantic, even if it's eating at a dimly-lit sushi bar or taking a long walk on a starry night.  Don't make her think that you just have a fetish for older women and that being with her or talking to her means you've won some kind of prize. Instead, you should ask her about her interests, what she likes to do on the weekends, and about the relationships that mean the most to her. As you're getting to know her, you don't have to pry or interview her, but you should show that you want to know who she really is -- it's cool that she's four years older than you, but that's not her defining characteristic.When you see her, ask her how her day was. It can be as simple as that.Ask her opinion on a variety of subjects, from her favorite bands to a new political candidate.  Older women tend to be more confident and experienced than younger women, which means that they can keep up a better conversation a lot of the time. While recapping last night's football game for an hour may be okay with your buddies, you should make an effort to read the papers, watch the news, and read interesting literature that makes you a more well-rounded person. This way, you'll not only broaden your horizons, but you'll have more to talk about.If you read something really interesting that day, talk to her about it. See what she thinks.Talk about relationships. You can discuss you relationship with your siblings, or your bond with a close friend -- just don't talk about your ex girlfriend.Talk about your travel experiences. Even if all you did was spend a summer a few states away, discuss the interesting aspects of your trip.Maintain a witty banter. If she says something funny, don't just laugh, but counter her comment with another funny statement. This will show her that you can really keep up.  Though it may have been amusing or fun for her to be talking to a younger guy at first, you don't have to keep joking about how much younger you are, or how she's so much more experienced. Unless you want her calling you ""junior"" and thinking of you as a kid brother, you should avoid mentioning this too much, or she'll think that you're obsessing over it -- or worse, she may start obsessing over your age difference too.Don't bring it up in front of others, either. If you're meeting her friends or introducing her to your friends, keep it cool. Her friends may not even notice that you're a bit younger if you play your cards right.  You may be so focused on trying to impress and attract an older woman that you may be forgetting who you really are. You shouldn't act like a different person completely, or she'll see right through you. No woman wants to be with a guy who isn't genuine. Remember that you're building your maturity and developing desirable qualities that would make you appeal to a woman -- or any woman, really -- but that it doesn't mean you have to be someone else completely.If you have a secret ""dorky"" hobby, don't be afraid to tell her about it if it means a lot to you.Let her see the best qualities that your other friends see. The friends who are your age must like you for some reason, so don't hide your strongest qualities completely.","['If you want to treat an older woman right, then you absolutely have to be a gentleman.', 'This may be a foreign concept to you, but all it really means is that you should treat her like a lady and give her kindness and respect.', 'If you pick her up in your car, hold the passenger door open for her, and hold the door open for her if you enter a restaurant or any other location.', 'If she comes over, take her coat and hang it up.', 'Here are some other ways to be a gentleman:Show up on time, or even a little early.', 'Let her see that she means a lot to you.', 'Always complement her.', 'Tell her she looks stunning, beautiful, or however she may look that day.', ""Don't be embarrassed to tell her what you really think -- this will win her over as long as you do it in moderation."", ""Don't spit, scratch yourself, burp, or do other un-gentlemanly things."", 'Always look nice.', 'Make an effort to shower, groom yourself, and to wear unwrinkled and well-fitting clothing.', ""This will show her that you've put thought and effort into seeing her."", 'Take her out on nice dates.', ""Don't take her to the local Burger King."", ""You may not have a lot of spending money, but you should make an effort to do something that is at least romantic, even if it's eating at a dimly-lit sushi bar or taking a long walk on a starry night."", ""Don't make her think that you just have a fetish for older women and that being with her or talking to her means you've won some kind of prize."", 'Instead, you should ask her about her interests, what she likes to do on the weekends, and about the relationships that mean the most to her.', ""As you're getting to know her, you don't have to pry or interview her, but you should show that you want to know who she really is -- it's cool that she's four years older than you, but that's not her defining characteristic."", 'When you see her, ask her how her day was.', 'It can be as simple as that.', 'Ask her opinion on a variety of subjects, from her favorite bands to a new political candidate.', 'Older women tend to be more confident and experienced than younger women, which means that they can keep up a better conversation a lot of the time.', ""While recapping last night's football game for an hour may be okay with your buddies, you should make an effort to read the papers, watch the news, and read interesting literature that makes you a more well-rounded person."", ""This way, you'll not only broaden your horizons, but you'll have more to talk about."", 'If you read something really interesting that day, talk to her about it.', 'See what she thinks.', 'Talk about relationships.', ""You can discuss you relationship with your siblings, or your bond with a close friend -- just don't talk about your ex girlfriend."", 'Talk about your travel experiences.', 'Even if all you did was spend a summer a few states away, discuss the interesting aspects of your trip.', 'Maintain a witty banter.', ""If she says something funny, don't just laugh, but counter her comment with another funny statement."", 'This will show her that you can really keep up.', ""Though it may have been amusing or fun for her to be talking to a younger guy at first, you don't have to keep joking about how much younger you are, or how she's so much more experienced."", 'Unless you want her calling you ""junior"" and thinking of you as a kid brother, you should avoid mentioning this too much, or she\'ll think that you\'re obsessing over it -- or worse, she may start obsessing over your age difference too.', ""Don't bring it up in front of others, either."", ""If you're meeting her friends or introducing her to your friends, keep it cool."", ""Her friends may not even notice that you're a bit younger if you play your cards right."", 'You may be so focused on trying to impress and attract an older woman that you may be forgetting who you really are.', ""You shouldn't act like a different person completely, or she'll see right through you."", ""No woman wants to be with a guy who isn't genuine."", ""Remember that you're building your maturity and developing desirable qualities that would make you appeal to a woman -- or any woman, really -- but that it doesn't mean you have to be someone else completely."", 'If you have a secret ""dorky"" hobby, don\'t be afraid to tell her about it if it means a lot to you.', 'Let her see the best qualities that your other friends see.', ""The friends who are your age must like you for some reason, so don't hide your strongest qualities completely.""]"
"Talk to her!,Spend more time with her. Make her laugh. Find common ground. Don't be afraid to be yourself!,Take care of yourself. Go on a date. Follow up with a second date (and another, and another...).",How to Attract a Christian Girl1,"Yes, you've all heard this a million times, but it works! If you're in the same Youth Group, talk to her about the Bible study. Ask her if she's planning on going to the meeting next week, or if she's planning on going to the up coming worship night. That sort of thing. Those are great conversation starters! Don't say, ""Oh, so you help your dad clean here on Saturdays. How Interesting!"" Ask her opinion. , You can't truly love someone without getting to know them, so if you have a crush on some girl, start trying to get to know her better! Look for opportunities to share God's love together. For instance, try sitting next to her in Bible study. Don't be afraid to talk to her. More than likely, she'll be happy to start a conversation with you.  There is no greater joy than God's gift of laughter. Everyone loves to laugh. Try making a habit of engaging in some good-natured humor with your crush, you have an opportunity to strengthen the bond between the two of you, making way for greater love.  God gave every person talents and interests - capitalize on the ones your crush and you share! If the object of your affection is in to drawing and you are too, then try drawing together sometime. Or better yet, draw each other simultaneously - this is a real challenge that will probably make you laugh at how bad you both are at it.If, on the other hand she's into something that you aren't, like queuing for hours to get an autograph, you don't have to lie and pretend to like it, but do try instead to give it a shot. Try finding out why she likes it (""So, did you learn the Yakima flute gradually, or were you a natural?"") You don't have to like everything she does, but she'll really appreciate your attempts to become interested in what she likes.  Girls want to know the real you. Usually, the reason girls want boyfriends is because of the special bond a boy-girl relationship offers. Serious relationships allow a soul-to-soul intimacy that even being best friends can't replicate. A relationship, especially one founded on the love of Jesus, is no place for masculine posturing or for playing a a predefined role. Christian women appreciate strong and honest yet sensitive men - men that can laugh and can cry as well, men who can fess up, and men who can protect them yet still be kind and gentle.  Self-respect, demonstrated through the care you show yourself, is just as important to them as it is to anyone else. Pay attention to your physical appearance and hygiene. Try to stay healthy with proper diet and exercise. Keep a busy but reasonable schedule. By doing these things, not only do you make yourself more attractive, you also show the proper respect for the body you have been granted by God.  Religious people have fun too! Take your girl to the movies, a sporting event, a skating rink - anything she'd like based on her interests. Enjoy yourself, but maintain your respect for her and your love for Christ at all times by acting with tact and kindness. Above all, never, ever, force her into an uncomfortable situation.  Don't let a successful first date lead nowhere! After your date, drop hints that you would like to see her again. Say things like, ""See you soon,"" or ""Do you want to hang out next week?"" If she seems game, follow through with it!

"Make the first move. Accept rejection. Be careful. Don't trick her. Be friendly. Act casual and be yourself. Be consistent. The kiss. Be clear. Remember, the most important thing: be yourself!",How to Act Around Girls (for Boys),"Girls are often very insecure and don't want to embarrass both themselves and you by coming on too strong, so you should make the first move. One thing that may be going through a girl's mind is, ""What if he doesn't like me back? If he likes me, he can get off his shy butt and come over here and tell me!"";, If you ask a girl for her number and she rejects you, move on, as she's obviously not interested.  If, however, she does give you her number, try to only use it to arrange dates. It is all too easy to give a girl the wrong impression about how you feel. For example, constantly texting her will probably give her the idea that you are in love with her, and set very high expectations for your relationship.  Don't lead a girl on if you are going to change your mind. Of course you should not go out with her after the first date if there is no connection. If you feel there is no connection, say so early on and don't leave her hanging, this will result in resentment from her.  Let her know you are interested, but don't be too eager. See how she reacts when you start the conversation, and go from there.  Girls are much more likely to fall for you if you be yourself, rather than falling for the person you're pretending to be.  Don't behave strangely towards her around your friends. Many boys think that their friends will tease them if they are all ""loved up"" with their girlfriend. To make it easier, see your friends separately from your girlfriend. If you are together though, be yourself with your friends but make sure you don't leave your girlfriend out.  To get a girl to kiss you, you should be sure first that she likes you back. Then hint, touch her arm and look into her eyes, or look at her lips then at her. It is a good idea to make some contact before the kiss, so holding her hand or tucking her hair behind her ear is a good start. Lean in - but slowly so that if she doesn't look up for it you can just touch her arm and say something instead. If she leans toward you as well then good! Move your head slightly to one side first and she will follow. If she pulls away before you expected, don't be awkward, just act like you wanted it to end then as well. Don't pressure her into anything.  If a girl is hitting on you and you aren't interested, make it clear. Sure, she might get upset, but that is better than going along with it and breaking up with her later.

"Have a strong, healthy love for the Lord. Treat her with respect. Pray for her and ask her to pray for you. Put the Lord first. Act like a gentleman!",How to Attract a Christian Girl2,"Often, one of the things a Christian girl will find most attractive in a guy is a heart for God. A great way to display this love is to become a devout believer. You'll probably want to attend mass regularly (especially the masses she attends) and to take an active interest in scripture. However, you'll want to avoid extreme forms of dogmatism - don't use your religion to criticize her or impose limits on her. Everyone hates condemnation - any conviction should come from HER conscience, and if she asks you for advice, listen and share.  She's a Christian girl, so, chances are, she'll want a boy who will treat her like a real woman. Conduct yourself like a Christian should, by treating her with respect. Be a gentleman to her in whatever way you know how. To some, this will mean opening doors, carrying her books, and offering her your seat, while, to others, such traditional displays of respect will seem outdated. Never be casually lewd around her. Talking dirty may impress your friends, but most Christian girls will be off-put by this sort of talk. Some will show a wild side when they're more comfortable around you, while others never will.  If you are both very religious, you may want to pray for the object of your affections and (cautiously) ask her to do the same for you. You may ask for general well-wishing prayers, or for guidance from God for something specific you are struggling with in your walk with God. This has the potential for awkwardness, so try to avoid sharing intensely personal details until you are very close with this person. Instead, you may want to speak in generalities - sometimes, just asking for a prayer with no other explanation is enough.  Your Christian girlfriend should be a very important part of your life, but not your reason for living. If your love for Jesus isn’t motivation enough to grow in maturity and pursue godliness, then you are not ready for a Christian woman. Your first goal as a Christian man should be to grow in your relationship with God and to keep him at the center of your life. Do this before you think of starting a close relationship with any Christian woman. Only when Jesus is placed in the middle of the relationship and, more importantly, your own life, you can truly experience love as it is meant to be.  Most Christian girls are very classy, and they want classy men. Open the doors for her, pull out her chair, and always pay for the date. Remember to be polite and respectful around her family! Most Christian moms, and especially fathers, look for this in guys. They want a guy to treat her daughters right and be polite! By doing that, parents will probably approve of your relationship with her much more quickly, and it might give you a better chance to be alone with her quickly!","['Often, one of the things a Christian girl will find most attractive in a guy is a heart for God.', 'A great way to display this love is to become a devout believer.', ""You'll probably want to attend mass regularly (especially the masses she attends) and to take an active interest in scripture."", ""However, you'll want to avoid extreme forms of dogmatism - don't use your religion to criticize her or impose limits on her."", 'Everyone hates condemnation - any conviction should come from HER conscience, and if she asks you for advice, listen and share.', ""She's a Christian girl, so, chances are, she'll want a boy who will treat her like a real woman."", 'Conduct yourself like a Christian should, by treating her with respect.', 'Be a gentleman to her in whatever way you know how.', 'To some, this will mean opening doors, carrying her books, and offering her your seat, while, to others, such traditional displays of respect will seem outdated.', 'Never be casually lewd around her.', 'Talking dirty may impress your friends, but most Christian girls will be off-put by this sort of talk.', ""Some will show a wild side when they're more comfortable around you, while others never will."", 'If you are both very religious, you may want to pray for the object of your affections and (cautiously) ask her to do the same for you.', 'You may ask for general well-wishing prayers, or for guidance from God for something specific you are struggling with in your walk with God.', 'This has the potential for awkwardness, so try to avoid sharing intensely personal details until you are very close with this person.', 'Instead, you may want to speak in generalities - sometimes, just asking for a prayer with no other explanation is enough.', 'Your Christian girlfriend should be a very important part of your life, but not your reason for living.', 'If your love for Jesus isn’t motivation enough to grow in maturity and pursue godliness, then you are not ready for a Christian woman.', 'Your first goal as a Christian man should be to grow in your relationship with God and to keep him at the center of your life.', 'Do this before you think of starting a close relationship with any Christian woman.', 'Only when Jesus is placed in the middle of the relationship and, more importantly, your own life, you can truly experience love as it is meant to be.', 'Most Christian girls are very classy, and they want classy men.', 'Open the doors for her, pull out her chair, and always pay for the date.', 'Remember to be polite and respectful around her family!', 'Most Christian moms, and especially fathers, look for this in guys.', 'They want a guy to treat her daughters right and be polite!', 'By doing that, parents will probably approve of your relationship with her much more quickly, and it might give you a better chance to be alone with her quickly!']"
Look at her stance. Pay attention to eye contact. Take context into account. Notice if she touches you or tries to get closer. Pay attention to whether she randomly hugs you. See if she mirrors your moves. Notice if she’s playing with her hair. Look for signs of nervousness or fidgeting. Notice if she smiles around you.,How to Know if a Girl Likes You1,"When a girl likes you, she will face in your direction. If a girl has her torso turned towards you in an open manner, this means that she is confident talking with you. If she has a closed body position, namely crossed arms or legs, she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to signal that she is uninterested.When she is sitting with her legs crossed, watch her feet. If they are pointed towards you, it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you. , If a girl likes you, she will tend to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers. Either of these responses could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it often means she is nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet, but she may still like you.When a girl likes you, her pupils might dilate, though this will be hard to tell.If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, this could mean that she likes you.  The way you interpret a girl's body language will vary depending on the context. For example, if you're talking one-on-one with a girl, her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting. However, if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you, she may really just be trying to help, not flirt.If you are having an intense conversation, a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact. This does not necessarily mean she likes you. It could just be a conversational practice of hers. However, if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking, or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her, she may be intrigued by you.  When a girl likes you, she will often try to touch you, as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt. It allows a girl to size up how responsive you are. She may touch your arm when you say something funny, “accidentally” brush your shoulder or hands with hers, or gently place her hand on your knee.Not all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch. In this case, don't assume that she doesn't like you just because she doesn't try to touch you. She may be too nervous to do so. If you like her, don't be shy––break the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds.She may also find other reasons to touch you, such as softly punching your arm. These ""one-of-the-mates"" moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too evident to your friends and hers.  This is especially significant if her random hugs are reserved mostly for you. Hugs are a friendly, affectionate way of getting closer to you and touching you without it necessarily compromising her stealthy flirting skills. Return the hug if you like her back, or gently refuse her hug if you don’t want her to get the wrong impression.  If a girl imitates you - for example, if you run your fingers through your hair and you notice her do the same a few seconds later - she may be subconsciously mirroring your movements. This can be a tell that she likes you.  Gently twirling strands of her hair or partaking in other grooming behaviors like running her hands through her hair could be signs of flirting.  When a girl likes you, she will touch her lips, collarbone, or neck to draw your attention to these areas. She may even apply lipstick in front of you.  This may be her way of signaling to you that she’s comfortable and happy in your presence. When a girl likes you, she may also laugh at your jokes (regardless of how funny they actually are).","['When a girl likes you, she will face in your direction.', 'If a girl has her torso turned towards you in an open manner, this means that she is confident talking with you.', 'If she has a closed body position, namely crossed arms or legs, she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to signal that she is uninterested.', 'When she is sitting with her legs crossed, watch her feet.', 'If they are pointed towards you, it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you.', ', If a girl likes you, she will tend to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers.', 'Either of these responses could mean that she likes you.', 'If she pulls away quickly, it often means she is nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet, but she may still like you.', 'When a girl likes you, her pupils might dilate, though this will be hard to tell.', 'If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, this could mean that she likes you.', ""The way you interpret a girl's body language will vary depending on the context."", ""For example, if you're talking one-on-one with a girl, her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting."", 'However, if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you, she may really just be trying to help, not flirt.', 'If you are having an intense conversation, a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact.', 'This does not necessarily mean she likes you.', 'It could just be a conversational practice of hers.', 'However, if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking, or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her, she may be intrigued by you.', 'When a girl likes you, she will often try to touch you, as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt.', 'It allows a girl to size up how responsive you are.', 'She may touch your arm when you say something funny, “accidentally” brush your shoulder or hands with hers, or gently place her hand on your knee.', 'Not all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch.', ""In this case, don't assume that she doesn't like you just because she doesn't try to touch you."", 'She may be too nervous to do so.', ""If you like her, don't be shy––break the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds."", 'She may also find other reasons to touch you, such as softly punching your arm.', 'These ""one-of-the-mates"" moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too evident to your friends and hers.', 'This is especially significant if her random hugs are reserved mostly for you.', 'Hugs are a friendly, affectionate way of getting closer to you and touching you without it necessarily compromising her stealthy flirting skills.', 'Return the hug if you like her back, or gently refuse her hug if you don’t want her to get the wrong impression.', 'If a girl imitates you - for example, if you run your fingers through your hair and you notice her do the same a few seconds later - she may be subconsciously mirroring your movements.', 'This can be a tell that she likes you.', 'Gently twirling strands of her hair or partaking in other grooming behaviors like running her hands through her hair could be signs of flirting.', 'When a girl likes you, she will touch her lips, collarbone, or neck to draw your attention to these areas.', 'She may even apply lipstick in front of you.', 'This may be her way of signaling to you that she’s comfortable and happy in your presence.', 'When a girl likes you, she may also laugh at your jokes (regardless of how funny they actually are).']"
"Be receptive to compliments. Observe her friends’ reactions. Notice her style. Be mindful of gentle, friendly teasing. Notice if she makes excuses to talk to you. Notice if she mentions your relationship status. Look for ""damsel in distress"" moments. Test her interest by asking her for help. Notice how she acts around others.",How to Know if a Girl Likes You2,"If a girl compliments you, she could very well like you. This may be her way of making you feel desired.She might say things like “you have amazing eyes” or “you’re so athletic - do you play any sports?”, If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this probably means that she has told her friends about you and they're ""in the know."" In some cases, a friend may actually be bold enough to come and tell you that her friend likes you.When she is having a conversation with her friends and you come over, they might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means that you were the subject of the recently ended conversation.  When a girl likes you, she will often try to impress you with her style. She may choose to wear slightly revealing clothes or put on lipstick to catch your eye.Every girl has a different sense of style, and not all girls will try to dress as aforementioned when they like somebody. However, if you notice that the girl you’re wondering about dresses a little more nicely around you, it could be a sign that she wants to impress you.  When a girl likes you, she may tease you lightly about certain things you do or say. Ways of teasing include calling you out on a joke that actually wasn’t that funny, poking fun at something you’re wearing, or lightly telling you that you’re trying too hard.  She may “friend” you on social media, talk to you in person every day after class, or text you randomly. These could be signs that this girl is intrigued and wants to get to know you more.This alone is not a definitive sign that a girl likes you. A girl who just wants to be friends may also try to engage in conversation with you. But if a girl tries to talk to you often, exhibits a number of flirty body language cues, and compliments you often, she may be trying to tell you that she likes you.  When a girl likes you, she will want to know whether you are single or not so that she can decide if she should flirt with you. She may directly ask you if you have a girlfriend or she may use a subtler approach.She might tease you by saying things like “I bet you went to see that movie with your girlfriend.” If you like her, use this as an opportunity to flirt back. You could say “I don’t have a girlfriend, but I have been meaning to see that movie...want to go with me Friday night?”, When a girl likes you, she may pretend to be in a mildly vulnerable situation to test your response. For example, if you're outside and the girl you like starts saying ""I'm cold!"" that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweater. Doing so is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her.Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at doing something, like saying she doesn’t understand the homework. That is your chance to offer some assistance; be aware that she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to test your reaction in hopes that you will help out.When offering assistance, if she doesn't fancy you but there is somebody she likes in the room, she may pout or show other signs of disappointment if you offer to help first. In this case, at least you'll know how she feels and will be able to move on.  If she's always there for you when you need her, she might like you. But don't assume that she's into you only from one experience. Ask her occasionally for small things, like chewing gum or a pen, and notice how she reacts. If she's eager to help you and shows other signs of liking you, then she very well might.Don’t use this approach too much or a tasks that seem too difficult, she may think you're lazy, testing her, or are even a bit of a nuisance. So don't overdo it; you don't want to risk her ceasing to like you if she indeed does.  If a girl flirts with you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that she likes you. She may just get a thrill out of flirting, or she may not even notice that she’s flirting. The best way to see if she is just flirting with you and it’s not just her naturally flirty demeanor coming through is to notice how she acts around other people.If she treats you differently than she does others, be it by holding eye contact just a bit longer with you than with anybody else or by being gentler in her teasing with you, then she may like you.","['If a girl compliments you, she could very well like you.', 'This may be her way of making you feel desired.', 'She might say things like “you have amazing eyes” or “you’re so athletic - do you play any sports?”', ', If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this probably means that she has told her friends about you and they\'re ""in the know.""', 'In some cases, a friend may actually be bold enough to come and tell you that her friend likes you.', 'When she is having a conversation with her friends and you come over, they might stop talking all of a sudden.', 'This likely means that you were the subject of the recently ended conversation.', 'When a girl likes you, she will often try to impress you with her style.', 'She may choose to wear slightly revealing clothes or put on lipstick to catch your eye.', 'Every girl has a different sense of style, and not all girls will try to dress as aforementioned when they like somebody.', 'However, if you notice that the girl you’re wondering about dresses a little more nicely around you, it could be a sign that she wants to impress you.', 'When a girl likes you, she may tease you lightly about certain things you do or say.', 'Ways of teasing include calling you out on a joke that actually wasn’t that funny, poking fun at something you’re wearing, or lightly telling you that you’re trying too hard.', 'She may “friend” you on social media, talk to you in person every day after class, or text you randomly.', 'These could be signs that this girl is intrigued and wants to get to know you more.', 'This alone is not a definitive sign that a girl likes you.', 'A girl who just wants to be friends may also try to engage in conversation with you.', 'But if a girl tries to talk to you often, exhibits a number of flirty body language cues, and compliments you often, she may be trying to tell you that she likes you.', 'When a girl likes you, she will want to know whether you are single or not so that she can decide if she should flirt with you.', 'She may directly ask you if you have a girlfriend or she may use a subtler approach.', 'She might tease you by saying things like “I bet you went to see that movie with your girlfriend.”', 'If you like her, use this as an opportunity to flirt back.', 'You could say “I don’t have a girlfriend, but I have been meaning to see that movie...want to go with me Friday night?”, When a girl likes you, she may pretend to be in a mildly vulnerable situation to test your response.', 'For example, if you\'re outside and the girl you like starts saying ""I\'m cold!""', ""that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweater."", 'Doing so is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her.', 'Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at doing something, like saying she doesn’t understand the homework.', 'That is your chance to offer some assistance; be aware that she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to test your reaction in hopes that you will help out.', ""When offering assistance, if she doesn't fancy you but there is somebody she likes in the room, she may pout or show other signs of disappointment if you offer to help first."", ""In this case, at least you'll know how she feels and will be able to move on."", ""If she's always there for you when you need her, she might like you."", ""But don't assume that she's into you only from one experience."", 'Ask her occasionally for small things, like chewing gum or a pen, and notice how she reacts.', ""If she's eager to help you and shows other signs of liking you, then she very well might."", ""Don’t use this approach too much or a tasks that seem too difficult, she may think you're lazy, testing her, or are even a bit of a nuisance."", ""So don't overdo it; you don't want to risk her ceasing to like you if she indeed does."", 'If a girl flirts with you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that she likes you.', 'She may just get a thrill out of flirting, or she may not even notice that she’s flirting.', 'The best way to see if she is just flirting with you and it’s not just her naturally flirty demeanor coming through is to notice how she acts around other people.', 'If she treats you differently than she does others, be it by holding eye contact just a bit longer with you than with anybody else or by being gentler in her teasing with you, then she may like you.']"
Smile at her. Strike up a conversation. Be attentive. Suggest that you like her. Ask her out. Be receptive to her signals. Avoid overanalyzing.,How to Know if a Girl Likes You3,"A natural, genuine, carefree smile is the perfect way to let a girl know that you like being around her. It will also let her know that you’re a happy person, and since happiness can be contagious, she’ll associate positive emotions with you. If she returns your smile, you can bet she feels comfortable around you.  This is a great way to gauge her interest level. As you talk, notice if she gives you any signs or hints that she likes you or if uses vaguely romantic language. She could also show her interest in you by nodding frequently or repeating some of your phrases.To start a conversation, you can ask her an open-ended question about class, work, or pop culture. It could be something as simple as “what do you think about this band?” or “how’s your day going?”Don’t fret if the girl you like doesn’t initiate a conversation with you. If she likes you, she may be too shy or nervous to do so! Even if she seems like the most confident girl you know, she may have had a bad experience in the past or simply may not be ready to approach you yet but will be receptive if you start the conversation first.If you’re already friends, starting a conversation will be easy. In this case, the most effective way to tell if she likes you is to pick up on body language cues or to see if she treats you differently than she does her other friends.  If you like the girl, put your best foot forward by remembering a few small details about the things she tells you. Listen carefully to the things she says so that you will have them for future reference.For example, if she tells you the name of her favorite band, bring up one of the band’s songs during your next chat. She’ll be impressed that you took notice! If she wasn’t already interested in you romantically, she might start to reconsider once she sees how attentive you are.Talking also provides another opportunity to observe her body language, so watch for physical cues such as subtle touches.  Only do this if you actually do like her and if you get the sense that she likes you back. This is a blunt move which can seem daunting, but if you like the girl and are fairly certain she might like you back, a bold approach which could open the door to you asking her out on a date with the certainty that she likes you back.You can let her know you’re interested by saying something like “I really like having you as a friend, but I’d love to be more than friends.”Don’t tell her you like her if you are just looking to satisfy your curiosity about her interest in you. This can be hurtful and can sever her trust in you.  If you like the girl but aren’t sure if she likes you back, you can test the waters by saying “I’ve been hearing great things about this movie,___. Would you like to come see it with me?” Keep the tone casual. If she says yes, you’ll know she’s interested. If she says no, you can change the conversation to something else.  Back off if you get the sense that she actually doesn’t like you or engage in a flirty banter if you sense there is mutual interest.If the girl you like objects to your romantic advances, even when you thought she liked you back, don't take it personally. A good relationship starts with a strong mutual connection. Moreover, there are plenty of other girls who will be right for you.  Trying to figure out whether a girl likes you can be all-consuming and distracting. Over-analyzing her behavior may result in your becoming obsessed with simply ""winning her over"" rather than getting to know her as a person.Rather than investing tons of time in determining whether or not she likes you, take opportunities every now and then to spend time with her and her friends. Just make sure to make your intentions relatively clear (via subtle flirting), or else you may become permanently ""friend-zoned.""","['A natural, genuine, carefree smile is the perfect way to let a girl know that you like being around her.', 'It will also let her know that you’re a happy person, and since happiness can be contagious, she’ll associate positive emotions with you.', 'If she returns your smile, you can bet she feels comfortable around you.', 'This is a great way to gauge her interest level.', 'As you talk, notice if she gives you any signs or hints that she likes you or if uses vaguely romantic language.', 'She could also show her interest in you by nodding frequently or repeating some of your phrases.', 'To start a conversation, you can ask her an open-ended question about class, work, or pop culture.', 'It could be something as simple as “what do you think about this band?”', 'or “how’s your day going?”Don’t fret if the girl you like doesn’t initiate a conversation with you.', 'If she likes you, she may be too shy or nervous to do so!', 'Even if she seems like the most confident girl you know, she may have had a bad experience in the past or simply may not be ready to approach you yet but will be receptive if you start the conversation first.', 'If you’re already friends, starting a conversation will be easy.', 'In this case, the most effective way to tell if she likes you is to pick up on body language cues or to see if she treats you differently than she does her other friends.', 'If you like the girl, put your best foot forward by remembering a few small details about the things she tells you.', 'Listen carefully to the things she says so that you will have them for future reference.', 'For example, if she tells you the name of her favorite band, bring up one of the band’s songs during your next chat.', 'She’ll be impressed that you took notice!', 'If she wasn’t already interested in you romantically, she might start to reconsider once she sees how attentive you are.', 'Talking also provides another opportunity to observe her body language, so watch for physical cues such as subtle touches.', 'Only do this if you actually do like her and if you get the sense that she likes you back.', 'This is a blunt move which can seem daunting, but if you like the girl and are fairly certain she might like you back, a bold approach which could open the door to you asking her out on a date with the certainty that she likes you back.', 'You can let her know you’re interested by saying something like “I really like having you as a friend, but I’d love to be more than friends.', '”Don’t tell her you like her if you are just looking to satisfy your curiosity about her interest in you.', 'This can be hurtful and can sever her trust in you.', 'If you like the girl but aren’t sure if she likes you back, you can test the waters by saying “I’ve been hearing great things about this movie,___.', 'Would you like to come see it with me?”', 'Keep the tone casual.', 'If she says yes, you’ll know she’s interested.', 'If she says no, you can change the conversation to something else.', 'Back off if you get the sense that she actually doesn’t like you or engage in a flirty banter if you sense there is mutual interest.', ""If the girl you like objects to your romantic advances, even when you thought she liked you back, don't take it personally."", 'A good relationship starts with a strong mutual connection.', 'Moreover, there are plenty of other girls who will be right for you.', 'Trying to figure out whether a girl likes you can be all-consuming and distracting.', 'Over-analyzing her behavior may result in your becoming obsessed with simply ""winning her over"" rather than getting to know her as a person.', 'Rather than investing tons of time in determining whether or not she likes you, take opportunities every now and then to spend time with her and her friends.', 'Just make sure to make your intentions relatively clear (via subtle flirting), or else you may become permanently ""friend-zoned.""']"
"Get to know her. Show her that you like her regardless of her age. Don't rush into it. Be friendly and caring. Flirt!,Be understanding. Practice, practice, practice!",How to Attract a Younger Girl That Barely Knows You,"This is the first and most important step. It doesn't matter if she is younger than you, before you ever engage in a relationship, you need to get a better understanding of each other. For most girls, a good conversation is a turn-on and may open her eyes to you. Ask questions about her, her family, what she likes to do, etc. This could also help decide if she is the girl for you, or if maybe you don't like her as much as you thought you did. If you have your eyes set on a girl in her young teens, remember how young she is. Maybe not ready for the kind of relationship that you are ready for, at whatever age you are. So you may have to wait or dismiss the idea that you will ever go out;, She'll be able to tell if you're constantly mentioning it, which will make you seem less genuine and truthful.  Resist the urge to just ask her out. Real relationships take time and effort to build. Besides, randomly asking her out will confuse her and increase your chances of being turned down.  Ask her how she's doing today. Don't ignore her in front of your friends just because she is younger. Show your interest, first in a platonic sense. This will let her know that you care, first as a friend, and then later as something more. A really good idea is to invite her along and get her to feel included.  But only when you feel like your relationship has progressed to that point. Subtle romantic gestures are cute, such as random flowers. Use your knowledge of her to think of specific ideas that will make her swoon. Perhaps wait until she starts to flirt with you, Maybe she doesn't want to date you. Maybe she isn't ready. Above all, you must remember that a relationship takes two people. Don't pressure her into anything she doesn't want to do.  Any skill worth having is worth developing, and like anything, this is a skill that takes time. If at first you don't succeed, keep trying with someone else.

Learn about what her interests are and start getting interested in them. Play sports with her or hang out with her. Find out some funny jokes. Leave the clothing compliments aside. Make sure she is available before making your move on her. Slowly but confidently start flirting with her. Build things up. Be patient. Ask her out to a place where a tomboy would go.,How to Attract a Tomboy,"Naturally, don't change yourself; just try to see if some of those interests enthuse you and adjust a little. , Do this progressively, so as not to freak her out with your sudden interest in her sporting activities.Ask her about some sports and video games, riding bikes and outdoor activities. Try some things she does and see if you like the game or the sport or activity.  Most girls love funny guys, even if they are tomboys. Even if it's bad puns, be funny. It's vital.  It is not really a good idea to compliment a tomboy on her outfit. The chances are that she became a tomboy to avoid the whole girly-girl cutesy thing.  Girls (and tomboys) don't like guys hitting on them when they have a boyfriend already.  Do this in a way that isn't that noticeable and more by way of mate-ship.

If you just act normal while she’s making her feelings obvious, she will probably eventually realize why.  Exhaust all other options before you tell a girl directly that you aren’t interested in her.

She will probably make small movements and position her body in a way that is welcoming. To show that you don’t feel the way she does, counter her movements. If she sits a little too close to you, scoot away from her a little bit.Also consider crossing your arms sometimes when she approaches you. This is a natural sign of resistance.  If you’ve tried to be clear in other ways and she’s still being forward, it’s probably time to be direct. Remember to speak to her the way you’d like to be spoken to if you were in her position. Try using “I” statements to keep the conversation more about you. Listing reasons why you don’t like her is rude and will damage her confidence, so don’t do that.

Instead of telling how beautiful she looks, say something like ""I love how you manage to light up an entire room just by being you."", Just blurting out 'you're beautiful' to a girl probably isn't going to do much for her or you, especially if either of you are drunk. Telling a girl she's beautiful (if you're looking to do it properly) needs to be properly timed.Try to do it at an unusual time. Most girls have been told they're beautiful when they're all dressed up for a night out. Try telling her she's beautiful just after she's come back from the gym, or when she's not wearing any make-up. It'll feel more meaningful and sincere.  Instead of looking at this moment as you putting yourself out there, try to think of it as you trying to make someone's day brighter. This way you'll feel better about yourself and you'll find it easier to tell the girl she's beautiful.Being nervous is okay, though. You can even tell her ""I really wanted to tell you how beautiful you are, but you make me really nervous."", When you're telling her that you find her beautiful, be authentic about it. Focus on what you do indeed find beautiful about her, in terms of looks and in terms of personality.  Words like ""beautiful"" and ""pretty"" and ""hot"" have been way overused and don't have that much meaning, anymore. try to find different words to describe her that mean beautiful, or can get across how beautiful you find her.To name a few fun and different ones: ""radiant,"" ""breathtaking,"" ""elegant,"" ""riveting,"" or ""dazzling."", Telling a girl that she's beautiful can be part of your way to let a girl know that you'd like to have a better and more meaningful connection with her.

Sweep the floor and shovel up any remaining manure. If possible, leave the floor to dry and air for a while before pulling back the shavings to lay the bed. If necessary, add new shavings.

Start things off to invite her to talk. Ask her some questions. Make yourself look good throughout the conversation. Accept pauses. Keep the conversation light. Focus on body language. Keep the attention always on her. End on a good note if she tells you that she has to leave.,How to Keep the Conversation Flowing with a Girl (for Guys),"Pay attention to the scenario, and mold your invitation to the circumstances. Don't, for example, ask her a random astronomy question when she's shopping for shoes. Here are a different ways to accomplish this:If you want to strike up a conversation with a girl you don't know, try making a recommendation. For example, if you see a beautiful girl at a coffee shop, and she looks undecided about her order, then recommend your favorite drink or tell her that you're going to guess exactly what she wants just by looking at her.When you already know the girl, start with some common ground. If you're in school together, then make a comment about classes or talk about your extra curricular activities. If you're working together, then start a chat about some workplace news, or ask for her help with something that you're working on.Ask her for a minor favor. For example, ask her to watch your stuff (like your phone) while you go get her something to drink. Girls will feel more interested in you if they've done a favor for you. It will also make them feel trustworthy and maybe even curious.Pay her a compliment. If she looks great that day or if she said something amazing during class, then tell her so. Compliment her hair, or her smile, or her dress. Stay away from her more feminine features. Make sure your compliment is genuine and not phony. , You want to show her that you're interested in her while at the same time deciding whether she's really worth your interest.A great question will make her think, laugh, and like you, all at the same time.Avoid ""yes"" and ""no"" questions. A question like, ""Did you like the new movie that came out this weekend?"" will get you either a ""yes"" or a ""no"" but may not launch a meaningful conversation. Instead, ask her what other movies she's seen and why she likes them. This type of question will get a much longer answer from her.Girls often like guys to make the first move. Instead of waiting for her to ask you questions, be proactive and do the asking first. Once she's answered your question, nod and then provide your own perspective. You want a balanced conversation in which you find out what she's all about while also sharing parts of yourself.Find out what she's passionate about. If you like this girl, then chances are you find something about her really fascinating. Ask her why she likes what she likes, or why she thinks what she thinks. Ask her something that you genuinely want to learn more about instead of asking questions just to get her to talk. If you're insincere, she'll know, and your conversation will be dead in the water.People love to talk about themselves. If you find out what she's passionate about, the conversation will go naturally and easily. This is the easiest way to build a connection.  You want to find out as much as you can about her, but you also want to make sure that you show yourself at your best.Talk about a subject that makes you feel passionate and persuasive. When you're talking about something really positive, you're going to be at your best. If you're passionate about music, then talk about your favorite bands. If you have something that you love to do, then talk about it with her.Make sure that you give her equal time. You definitely want to share something about yourself, but if you only talk about you, she's going to think you're self-centered, and she's not going to talk to you.Don't offer opinions about subjects you know nothing about. Your goal is to impress the girl with your wit, your conversation, and your intelligence. If you blather about something you're opinionated but uninformed about, you won't come off as very intelligent.  You're not going to be able to think of something to say at every point during the conversation, and that's completely okay. Pauses are a natural part of conversation. Get her comfortable with the idea of pauses by using pauses or deliberations sparingly in your own speech.Smile at her, take a sip from your drink or look around the room until you come up with something new to say. As long as you seem confident and interested, she'll wait with a lot of anticipation for the next step in the conversation. If you look nervous or stare at your feet, then she'll feel uncomfortable, and she's likely to say ""see you later.""Use pauses throughout the conversation. When you pause, look as though you are carefully considering what you want to say. She'll be invested in trying to find out what you're going to say next, and she may feel compelled to fill the silence with her own conversation.People's rate of speech naturally synchronizes when they're talking. That means that people unconsciously mimic how quickly the other person is talking. So if you talk slowly, she'll talk slowly, and the conversation will last longer. The secret to talking slowly is being confident, not nervous.Think of the pauses as her chance to impress you. Don't feel like you need to generate topic after topic for conversation. During the pause, you want to silently invite her to take the initiative. If she does, then you'll know that she's enjoying talking to you.  Don't delve into any controversial subjects or anything that she may find uncomfortable. Also, don't gossip about other people, because she may think that you're not genuinely nice.Use your sense of humor. Don't dive in with a really off-color joke or something that could be shocking to her. Keep it light and test the waters before you say anything that she might think is mean or offensive.Practice funny stories. More than simply jokes, people love hearing stories about funny things that happened to you. So keep track of funny or entertaining things that happened to you and rehearse the story you want to tell with friends.Know your pop culture. Keep up on the latest celebrity news and what's new in movies and music. When you know what's going on out there, you'll always have something light to talk about. Plus, you might just impress her with the number of things that you know.  For yourself, use great eye contact, sit up straight and smile warmly. When you do these things, she'll feel as though you're focused on her.Watch the way she uses her body. If she makes eye contact with you, lightly touches your arm or leans in toward you while you're talking, then you can feel confident that she's into you.Make sure you're projecting good body language, too. Don't cross your arms, tap your feet, sigh or groan audibly. All these tics are signs that you're bored or dissatisfied with her.If she's constantly looking away, fiddling with her drink or her jewelry or looking like she can't wait to escape, then you may be losing her interest. You can try saying something like, ""Are you having a bad day? You look like you're a million miles away."" Or, if the conversation hasn't been all that interesting to begin with, just politely say, ""Nice talking to you"" and walk away.  Let her know that you think she's important. Don't be cagey about turning the spotlight on you. Instead, focus it mainly on her.Turn off your cell phone while you're having a conversation with a girl. If you go outside to take a call, you may come back and find that she's moved on.If you run into friends, introduce your friends to her but remain focused on your conversation. Try to send nonverbal signals to your friends letting them know that they need to talk to you another time.  Tell her that you enjoyed talking to her and getting to know her. If you felt a real connection to her, ask for her phone number. The next morning, send her a text saying that you had a great time, and wish her a good day. You might get a second chance at continuing that initial conversation if she texts you back.A good rule of thumb is to wait a least a day before you call her, especially if you approached her as a stranger. You don't want her to think you're too forward, and you don't want to appear too needy, so it is best to delay for a day.When you call her, keep things short and sweet. Unless she's really enjoying the conversation, simply ask her if she'd want to see a movie or go out for coffee and leave it at that. You want to impress her in person, where you can do better damage-control if something goes wrong.Keep it low key until you know that she really likes you. She may feel a bit weird if you're pushing really hard and she's not, so try to get a good balance going. And at all times, keep the conversation flowing.","['Pay attention to the scenario, and mold your invitation to the circumstances.', ""Don't, for example, ask her a random astronomy question when

Check the pasture. Note the problem areas. Clean the pasture. Deal with fencing. Examine the pasture's resources. Bring in the horses.,How to Prepare a Pasture for Horses,"Walk over the entire pasture and check for anything that could harm your horse. Such things to watch out for would be: glass,ragwort, barbed wire, splintered wood, large (or even small) pieces of metal, and holes. These can all cause serious harm, or even death, to your animal if not removed, so take careful note. , Do not pick up or fill in anything in the first run-through of the pasture. Make a map of the pasture, and mark where there are problem areas that have any of the aforementioned problems. This will help you later when you are doing the final run-through, as well as help you notice any pattern in the locations of debris. If you see broken glass or pieces of man-made materials in a certain area more than once, make a mark on the map, and check the surrounding area extra carefully, just in case something was broken or dumped around that area, and spread.  With a large plastic garbage bag, thick rubber gloves, and a shovel, address any problem areas in the pasture. If you already have a horse living in the pasture, make note of if they are afraid of plastic bags- some horses are. If this is the case, steer clear of the horse while doing this, or place the horse in another pasture entirely.Fill in the holes. This will take a while, of course, but is one of the most important parts to ensuring the safety of your horses. Take dirt from an area where there is some extra, such as from the embankment of the pond, and where you can expect the dirt to fill in relatively soon. Fill in any holes large enough for you to stick your fist into. Take care- if you cannot see the bottom of the hole, it very well may be a snake or gopher hole. If you are not prepared to deal with such animals, make a red mark on the map where that hole is, and come back later when you are prepared to do battle. For all other holes, fill in liberally, tamp the dirt down to make sure it's packed tightly, and come back in a week to make sure that the dirt hasn't settled into the hole, causing another hole.Dispose of the garbage. Recycle if at all possible. Otherwise, it'll end up being trash in someone else's pasture, or just dumped into the ground, and that's not much good in the long run, is it?Eradicate any weeds. Not only do weeds reduce the feeding value of your pasture, but some plants can make horses sick, so find out which species are common in your area. Learn to identify them so that if you see them in the pasture, you can remove them with a shovel, root and all. Keep an eye on those spots for regrowth and use herbicides if necessary. Walk the length of the fencing you are using for the pasture, and make sure it is intact. If you have fencing that breaks often, you may want to replace the entire fence.Barbed wire is not a good idea for horses- they can easily hurt themselves by various means with barbed wire, and, to boot, many rescue agencies don't allow you to adopt a horse from them if you have barbed wire.Wooden fences are a safe bet, but break often if you don't maintain them well.Electrical fencing may sound like a good idea, but only in moderation. Using one cord of electrical fence on the top of a wooden fence is normally a relatively safe idea if you have a horse that jumps the fence a lot, but, for the sake of the horse and your electrical bill, turn it down as low as possible.Examine all entrances and exits to the pasture. These are normally the weak points in fencing, since gating may all be dependent upon one half-inch thick rope, and that's it. If your gating situation is similar, seriously consider purchasing a metal gate that has an actual lock on it. Even if your horses are quite tame and docile, the sweetest horse can still take any chance to escape. It's quite a hassle to round them up again. In addition to keeping the horses in, a strong gate is vital to keeping other things out of the pasture. While a determined person probably could just jump the fence, a large animal is easily stopped by maintaining the gating and fencing situation.Talk to your neighbors if you share a fence with them. Tell them that you are preparing to bring in a new horse and need to be sure that they are not planning on changing anything about the fencing if the current fence is acceptable. If the current fencing is not acceptable, tell them before changing anything about the fence, as they may have a reason for leaving the fence as it is. If that is the case, you may have to build a second fence on your side of the pasture. This cuts off your land earlier, but solves any neighbor problems you may be having, and helps control any unruly animals they may have that could pose a danger to your horses.  Now that it is clean, take this chance to make sure the pasture is actually habitable by horses.Make sure the food supply is adequate. Are your horses going to eat purely grass from the pasture, and survive off of that? If so, see the Tips below. Or are you planning on feeding them hay and horse feed? Make sure that the feeding area is near water, and if you have multiple horses, set up multiple feeding areas broken off from one another. Very often, one horse dominates over the other, and will steal the weaker horse's food. If they are just going to graze for food, verify that there is enough grass. If you live in a dry, arid climate, there may very well not be enough grass growing to feed your horses. Buying bales of hay in the winter is a very good idea; you can simply place a bale out in the pasture, and let the horses eat off of it when they wish to.Ensure adequate water is available for your horses. This is absolutely crucial. A larger paddock may have a dam in it, or it may have a river running through it. In many horse paddocks, you may have to ferry water to a water trough or tub. Simply take a couple of old wash tubs and place them out in the pasture. Fill with water whenever possible. Take another tub and place it where you can easily get to it, and keep it supplied with water at all times.Ensure that the troughs are clean, and away from over hanging branches, as falling leaves will cause the water to become unsanitary faster.Have the trough close to a fence, so as it won't become a hazard to running horses, and so you are able to remove the trough (if portable) in a case of emergency or situation.If you have two adjoining paddocks, an old bathtub may be useful, as you are able to have it in both paddocks by cutting a hole in the fence and having half of the bathtub on each side. Make sure that the tub is clean and free of cracks and sharp edges. A plug is essential to prevent the water from draining out. You can pick up old bath tubs from recycle plants or you can inquire at your local bathtub specialist.  Bring your horses in during daylight hours, preferably 3 or more hours prior to the sun setting. This way, your horses can learn about their new surroundings, and there will be a less of a chance of finding an injured horse in the morning. Watch them carefully for a couple of days and inspect any wounds that they may develop. If any wounds do develop, and you have reason to suspect that it had something to do with the pasture that could have been avoided (e.g. a long gash along the side, indicating barbed wire somewhere in the field), remove the horses and go back to step one. You want the horses to be as safe and as happy as possible.Checking the fence at least once every 2 or 3 days is also a good idea. If you have time, do a quick check of the pasture and fence once a day.","['Walk over the entire pasture and check for anything that could harm your horse.', 'Such things to watch out for would be:

Provide suitable grazing. Provide water. Be sure to provide Shelter. Be sure to divide the field. Know what to feed your horses. Do a daily clean up droppings. Examine the grass for holes or sharp bits of material. Prevent loneliness.,How to Care for Horses Living Out,"Keeping a horse in a field seems simple, but a good field needs regular care to provide enough grass to eat. Each horse or pony needs at least 1/2 a hectare ( one acre) to graze, or more if possible. The grass should be healthy, and free of poisonous plants such as ragwort or yew. , A clean water supply is vital, as horses drink about 36 litres (8 gallons) a day. Ideally, there should be a trough which refills from the mains water supply automatically. If this isn't possible, fill the trough each day with buckets of clean water. If it becomes cloudy, the trough needs draining with a scrubbing brush which is clean, but with NO DETERGENT.  Horses need shelter to escape from flies, the sun and bad weather. A high dense hedge is enough for some ponies, but ideally they should have a three-sided shed. The open side has easy access to in and out of the shed and prevents one horse from getting trapped in the corner by the others.  Dividing the field- If horses live in one field for a long time, the field may become horse sick. This is where some areas are over grazed, and the grass become sparse, but around the horses droppings it becomes lush and infested with worms. To prevent this, fence the field off into 2 sections and graze one section at a time. The other left- section has been allowed a rest from grazing for a time to grow back more grass.  When a horse lives out for most of the year and no one is riding him, he doesn't need any extra food in the summer months and only needs hay in the winter. If a horse is being ridden regularly, he needs other food, such as horse cubes or nuts, grains or sugar beet, to keep his energy levels up. The amount he needs depends on how big he is, and how much work he is doing. Chaff is chopped up hay. It is a good addition to a horse's winter diet. Pony cubes are an excellent all round source of energy for a working horse. ,, Being herd animals, Horses get lonely if they are kept in a big space on their own. If possible, a horse should be kept with at least one other horse for company. Even another animal such as a sheep will be better than nothing.","['Keeping a horse in a field seems simple, but a good field needs regular care to provide enough grass to eat.', 'Each horse or pony needs at least 1/2 a hectare ( one acre) to graze, or more if possible.', 'The grass should be healthy, and free of poisonous plants such as ragwort or yew.', ', A clean water supply is vital, as horses drink about 36 litres (8 gallons) a day.', 'Ideally, there should be a trough which refills from the mains water supply automatically.', ""If this isn't possible, fill the trough each day with buckets of clean water."", 'If it becomes cloudy, the trough needs draining with a scrubbing brush which is clean, but with NO DETERGENT.', 'Horses need shelter to escape from flies, the sun and bad weather.', 'A high dense hedge is enough for some ponies, but ideally they should have a three-sided shed.', 'The open side has easy access to in and out of the shed and prevents one horse from getting trapped in the corner by the others.', 'Dividing the field-', 'If horses live in one field for a long time, the field may become horse sick.', 'This is where some areas are over grazed, and the grass become sparse, but around the horses droppings it becomes lush and infested with worms.', 'To prevent this, fence the field off into 2 sections and graze one section at a time.', 'The other left- section has been allowed a rest from grazing for a time to grow back more grass.', ""When a horse lives out for most of the year and no one is riding him, he doesn't need any extra food in the summer months and only needs hay in the winter."", 'If a horse is being ridden regularly, he needs other food, such as horse cubes or nuts, grains or sugar beet, to keep his energy levels up.', 'The amount he needs depends on how big he is, and how much work he is doing.', 'Chaff is chopped up hay.', ""It is a good addition to a horse's winter diet."", 'Pony cubes are an excellent all round source of energy for a working horse.', ',, Being herd animals, Horses get lonely if they are kept in a big space on their own.', 'If possible, a horse should be kept with at least one other horse for company.', 'Even another animal such as a sheep will be better than nothing.']"

Be honest with your friends. Make sure your friends know that you're serious. Seek to have a two-way discussion. Reevaluate your friendships if your friends refuse to stop.,How to Stop Friends from Teasing About Crushes1,"Sometimes, friends won’t know if you’re not comfortable with their teasing until you say something. They might even think you enjoy it, since it gives you a chance to talk about your crush. Try simply telling them that you don't like to be teased about your crush. Express yourself and don’t give your friends the impression that you’re okay with their comments and remarks if you’re actually not.Don’t try to make your friends guess how you feel. If you smile and laugh on the outside, but secretly wish they'd stop, it's up to you to be more straightforward about the effect their teasing has on you.If your friends usually treat you well and respect your feelings, they will be glad you said something, and they'll probably stop teasing you right away. , If you aren't used to confronting people, it can be difficult to get your point across clearly. You might be tempted to joke about it or act like it's no big deal. However, your friends might not understand how much you dislike the teasing unless you take a more serious approach.When you bring up the teasing with your friends, use an assertive tone. Assertiveness helps with honest communication and helps cultivate genuine relationships. It allows you to be absolutely clear about your needs.Being assertive isn't the same as being condescending or rude. There is nothing rude about politely telling them how you feel.Start your discussion with phrases such as “I don’t like it when you tease me because…” or “Your teasing make me feel…” Be honest and direct without any intentions of hurting or offending your friends.  Wait for a time when everyone is feeling relaxed and has time for a full conversation. Ask your friends if they understand how their teasing makes you feel, and really listen to the answer. If you can create a dialogue of understanding, your friends will be much less likely to keep teasing you.Communication is also a two-way street. Be receptive to getting feedback from your friends. They will be more willing to listen to you if you’re willing to listen to them in return. Ask follow-up questions such as “how does that make you feel?” in order to understand any feelings or reactions your friends may be going through.Deep talks on subjects that feel personal can lead to even better friendships.  If they just don't get it, even after you tried to have a serious discussion, you may want to stop talking about your crush with them. You may even want to reconsider whether they are really your friends if they decide to keep teasing you after you've asked them to stop.When the subject of your crush comes up, don't reveal your feelings; you'll just give them more fodder for teasing.Consider talking about your crush only with people you trust not to use the information to get laughs.","['Sometimes, friends won’t know if you’re not comfortable with their teasing until you say something.', 'They might even think you enjoy it, since it gives you a chance to talk about your crush.', ""Try simply telling them that you don't like to be teased about your crush."", 'Express yourself and don’t give your friends the impression that you’re okay with their comments and remarks if you’re actually not.', 'Don’t try to make your friends guess how you feel.', ""If you smile and laugh on the outside, but secretly wish they'd stop, it's up to you to be more straightforward about the effect their teasing has on you."", ""If your friends usually treat you well and respect your feelings, they will be glad you said something, and they'll probably stop teasing you right away."", "", If you aren't used to confronting people, it can be difficult to get your point across clearly."", ""You might be tempted to joke about it or act like it's no big deal."", 'However, your friends might not understand how much you dislike the teasing unless you take a more serious approach.', 'When you bring up the teasing with your friends, use an assertive tone.', 'Assertiveness helps with honest communication and helps cultivate genuine relationships.', 'It allows you to be absolutely clear about your needs.', ""Being assertive isn't the same as being condescending or rude."", 'There is nothing rude about politely telling them how you feel.', 'Start your discussion with phrases such as “I don’t like it when you tease me because…” or “Your teasing make me feel…” Be honest and direct without any intentions of hurting or offending your friends.', 'Wait for a time when everyone is feeling relaxed and has time for a full conversation.', 'Ask your friends if they understand how their teasing makes you feel, and really listen to the answer.', 'If you can create a dialogue of understanding, your friends will be much less likely to keep teasing you.', 'Communication is also a two-way street.', 'Be receptive to getting feedback from your friends.', 'They will be more willing to listen to you if you’re willing to listen to them in return.', 'Ask follow-up questions such as “how does that make you feel?”', 'in order to understand any feelings or reactions your friends may be going through.', 'Deep talks on subjects that feel personal can lead to even better friendships.', ""If they just don't get it, even after you tried to have a serious discussion, you may want to stop talking about your crush with them."", ""You may even want to reconsider whether they are really your friends if they decide to keep teasing you after you've asked them to stop."", ""When the subject of your crush comes up, don't reveal your feelings; you'll just give them more fodder for teasing."", 'Consider talking about your crush only with people you trust not to use the information to get laughs.']"

Make a list of qualities you find attractive. Do things you enjoy. Consider your social circle. Explore the internet.,How to Start a Relationship1,"Many people meet someone and jump straight into a relationship because they prefer not to be single. While this does fill one of your needs, you have no way of knowing of that person will make you happy in the long run. The first thing that you should do is reflect on what you want out of a relationship and out of a partner, and what attracts you to someone else. Think about things like:Do I want to be with someone who is career or family oriented? What physical features do I find attractive in a person? What about a person’s personality attracts me? Do I want to be with someone who is spontaneous or predictable?Think about your list, but remember that no one can ultimately make you happy but yourself. Think about the traits that would compliment what you want in a happy life, rather than depending upon someone else to bring fulfillment to you. , The best way to meet people that have things in common with you is to go out and do the things you love doing. Inevitably, you will meet someone that enjoys doing the same things. This is a great start to a potential relationship, as you will naturally attract people when you are doing something you enjoy.For example, if you are an avid book reader, you might join a book club for people around your age.There are many organizations and groups from book clubs to adventure clubs that can help you spark a relationship with someone who enjoys similar things.  The friends you already have are likely to have common interests and know other people with interests like your own. Sometimes, a friendship can transition into a relationship easily if there’s an attraction between the two people. Friends can also introduce you to someone that they know and think you’d like.Do not try to force a relationship with a friend. This can lead to a failed relationship and a failed friendship.  Though the internet makes it easy for people to create a false representation of themselves, there are people out there who are looking for genuine relationships. You can explore dating sites and social media to meet people and get to know them. Just be careful when going out with a person you meet on the internet. You should always meet in a safe, public place.","['Many people meet someone and jump straight into a relationship because they prefer not to be single.', 'While this does fill one of your needs, you have no way of knowing of that person will make you happy in the long run.', 'The first thing that you should do is reflect on what you want out of a relationship and out of a partner, and what attracts you to someone else.', 'Think about things like:Do I want to be with someone who is career or family oriented?', 'What physical features do I find attractive in a person?', 'What about a person’s personality attracts me?', 'Do I want to be with someone who is spontaneous or predictable?Think about your list, but remember that no one can ultimately make you happy but yourself.', 'Think about the traits that would compliment what you want in a happy life, rather than depending upon someone else to bring fulfillment to you.', ', The best way to meet people that have things in common with you is to go out and do the things you love doing.', 'Inevitably, you will meet someone that enjoys doing the same things.', 'This is a great start to a potential relationship, as you will naturally attract people when you are doing something you enjoy.', 'For example, if you are an avid book reader, you might join a book club for people around your age.', 'There are many organizations and groups from book clubs to adventure clubs that can help you spark a relationship with someone who enjoys similar things.', 'The friends you already have are likely to have common interests and know other people with interests like your own.', 'Sometimes, a friendship can transition into a relationship easily if there’s an attraction between the two people.', 'Friends can also introduce you to someone that they know and think you’d like.', 'Do not try to force a relationship with a friend.', 'This can lead to a failed relationship and a failed friendship.', 'Though the internet makes it easy for people to create a false representation of themselves, there are people out there who are looking for genuine relationships.', 'You can explore dating sites and social media to meet people and get to know them.', 'Just be careful when going out with a person you meet on the internet.', 'You should always meet in a safe, public place.']"
Spend time together. Learn about the other person. Create trust.,How to Start a Relationship2,"Once you find someone that you are interested in, spend time with them. Go out on dates, meet up for lunch, or even just go for a walk and talk. Seeing each other frequently will give you the chance to connect with the other person.You should not see each other constantly. A few times a week is usually healthy, but smothering each other every day can actually be damaging to a new relationship. Moreover, coping with space may show you are not needy, which can also be attractive.  While you are spending time with the other person, it is important to ask genuine questions and pay attention to their answers. The more you learn about the person, the deeper your relationship can grow. They will also appreciate your honest desire to understand and care for them.For example, you might ask them about what things they liked to do as kids or whether or not they have any family nearby.Delay sexual intimacy until you feel comfortable communicating with them. That way you are less likely to have a misunderstanding when you finally do hook up.  Creating trust takes time. You have to be consistent and show up when the other person needs you. You have to keep promises that you make to them, whether it’s showing up for a date or helping them clean their house. It is also important to always tell them the truth, and if they ask something that you are uncomfortable sharing, tell them that.For example, if they asked you something deeply personal on a second date, you could say “I’m not really comfortable talking about that right now, but we can discuss it when we know each other better.”Trust often happens when you make yourself vulnerable. Opening yourself up to someone and showing them both your positive traits and your fears and insecurities help create deeper, lasting connections.","['Once you find someone that you are interested in, spend time with them.', 'Go out on dates, meet up for lunch, or even just go for a walk and talk.', 'Seeing each other frequently will give you the chance to connect with the other person.', 'You should not see each other constantly.', 'A few times a week is usually healthy, but smothering each other every day can actually be damaging to a new relationship.', 'Moreover, coping with space may show you are not needy, which can also be attractive.', 'While you are spending time with the other person, it is important to ask genuine questions and pay attention to their answers.', 'The more you learn about the person, the deeper your relationship can grow.', 'They will also appreciate your honest desire to understand and care for them.', 'For example, you might ask them about what things they liked to do as kids or whether or not they have any family nearby.', 'Delay sexual intimacy until you feel comfortable communicating with them.', 'That way you are less likely to have a misunderstanding when you finally do hook up.', 'Creating trust takes time.', 'You have to be consistent and show up when the other person needs you.', 'You have to keep promises that you make to them, whether it’s showing up for a date or helping them clean their house.', 'It is also important to always tell them the truth, and if they ask something that you are uncomfortable sharing, tell them that.', 'For example, if they asked you something deeply personal on a second date, you could say “I’m not really comfortable talking about that right now, but we can discuss it when we know each other better.', '”Trust often happens when you make yourself vulnerable.', 'Opening yourself up to someone and showing them both your positive traits and your fears and insecurities help create deeper, lasting connections.']"
